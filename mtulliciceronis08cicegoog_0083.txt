between the two (i. e, atter integritas), in accordance with a taslrion
exceedingly common in Cicero. ludes and integritas, loyalty and
uprightness, are cognate qualities, as are aequitas and liberalitas,
reasonableness (or fairness) and generosity. Cf. Sest.1 eosqui ore·
nia dalea et hnmana violarint vexarint perturbarint everterint, where
the words violarint vexarint go together and refer to divina, while
the last two words refer to humana. Other examples will be found
in Mayor’s n. on Phil. 2, 89. — cupiditas libido audacia: ‘pas-
sion, caprice, temerity’. Cic. generally (eg. Tusc. 1, 20) translates
ἐπιθυμία by enpi'ditas or cupiditates. He always uses andacia in a bad
sense3 cf. DeInvent.2,165 audacia...aitium est. Its use in a good
sense is very rare in other authors—constantia: cf. n. on 8 ’
constanti leonini. — ut : = quales. -- naturam . . . ducem: ci. n.
on 17. The sentiment is an echo oi Stoicism. The Stoies all said that
the true life was lit'e according to nature, but they were not agreed
as to the meaning of the word nature. Some took it to mean the
natural constitution ot man; others the constitution oi the universe,
from which by contemplation the wisc man drew his rules of lite.
With the words of Cicero here ct. Arch. 15 ego multos etc. — sic:
the adverb here takes the place ot an object to perspicere, such as
tale ale'qnid. — mihi perspicere videor: a modest way oi saying
perspicio. - ita: ‘under this condition’; so 13 Tusc. 3, 59 ea lege
nos esse natos nt.. — societas: this is the doctrine ot Aristotle
in his Politics (1, 1 φύσει ἄνθρωπος πολιτικὸν ζῷον), which Cicero
repeats and expands in many passages. Ci. especially Off. 1, 50
and 51, where the different grades of social union are set forth as
here; also Acad. 1, 2¹3 Leg. 1, 23 and 613 Fin. 3,66 and 5,66. On
the doctrine that social aod politica} organization is not the result
oi agreement or invention, but has its origin in the essential elementa
of man's nature, see Woolsey, Political Science, Part 2, Cb. 2, es·
pecially ξ 70. - ut ...accederet ι sc. nobis, nos or ad nos (all three
constructions being found with proxime accedere in Cicero). Cf. Off.
r, 50 optrirre societas hominurn coniunctioque servabitur, si utquisque
erit contienetissimns, ita in eum benignitatis plurimum caesaraeum also
tor utquisque cf. Verr. 4, 1433 Off. 1, 65; and below, 26, 29, 46.
- alieni: ‘strangers ’, whether ot our own or ot any other country.
Observe that alienus is never used in good Latin with the sense oi
the English ‘alien’. - natura ipsa: i. e. nature and ,nature only;
