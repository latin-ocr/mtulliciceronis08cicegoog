Pyrrhus and Hannibal. The traditional Roman view of Hannibal
is expressed by Horace's abominatus Hannibal (Epod. 16, 8), yet the
charges brought against him can be thoroughly disproved even from
the information preserved by Roman historians. See e. g. Liv. 21,
²13 25, 173 27, 28. Cf. n. on C. M. 7 5 lastae. On Pyrrhus consult
liddell, History of Rome, Bk. 3, Ch. 26. — oderit: here fut. ind.;

cum referring to the repetition olan action (‘ as often as ' ‘whenever ',
‘every time that ’) though generally accompanied by the indicative,
is sometimes, as here, used with the subjunctive. The subjunctive
gives a more hypothetical coloring to the verb statement and has
about the force of a general condition. See Madvig, 359; cf. A. 3223
G. 585, Rem.; H. 507, 3. - coniuncti: here no participle but a
mere adjective3 so many other past participles in Cic. lose their par·

sense than that iu 48. —et amoris: for amar is pm'nceps ad benevo-

the metaphor is modified by ut ita dicam, for which see n. on 49.

- minimum... se: cf. 26, 46; De Or. 1, 123 utin qnoque oratore
