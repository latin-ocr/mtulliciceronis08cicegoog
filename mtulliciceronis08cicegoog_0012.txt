(2.) Philus. Several friends ol Scipio are mentioned in
the dialogue. chief ot these is L. F urius Philus,¹ consul of the
year 136, a man of great knowledge and high character, and a
iriend and patron ol Greek literati. He is thought worthy by
Cicero to rank beside Cato and Laelius,²and is one oi the inter·
locutors in the De Rc Publica.

Ἴ (3.) Rupilius. P. Rupilius ⁸ was consul in 132, and exercised

great severity against the partisans ofTi. Gracchus. His consul-
ship is said to have been due to the aid os Scipio. He com·
manded in Sicily against the insurgent slaves and established a
code oi laws sor the administration oi that province.

(4.) Manilius. Μ’. (or M, the praenomen is uncertain)
Manilius,⁴ consul in 149, commanded in Africa sor some time
against the Carthaginians with Scipio as one of his officers.
He was a very eminent lawyer, and a close friend of Laelius

and Scipio, appearing in the Dc Rc Publica along with them.
(5.) Mummius. Spurius Mummius⁵ seems to have been a
very different man from his brother, the destroyer os Corinth.

He had both wit and literaryability, which recommended him to
the very intimate friendship of Scipi0, with whom he is joined in
Cicero’s De Re Publica.⁶ When, to secure Scipio's saiety, the
senate despatched him on an embassy to Asia, Mummius was his
companion. Mummius spent some time in Achaia as legatus to
his brother, and thence sent wittyepistles in verse to his friends
at horne.l As a politician he was apparently unpopular and un·
successiu13 and devoting himself to study he became a strong
Stoic. We hear ol him that he was particularly noted sorbis
detestation of the teachers oi Rhetoric.
