87¹] NOTES TO LAELIUS. 105

in a speech made by him on being raised to the throne. —— tum
maxime etc.: cf. 62.

P. 82. —aeta agimus: au oxymoron (so ‘to slay the slain’) for
which Seyffert compares Plaut. Mil. 3, r, 41 nata noscere ,· Poen 4, 2,
48 doctum docem Cic. Fam. 14,1,5 puerum perditum perdere. As
to the proverb, Donatus on Terent. Adelph. 2, a, 24 not improbably
conjectures that it originated in the law courts, ubi quod semel eadwa-
tum est frustm iterum agiacr. Cf. n. on ²3 absentes adsunt. — ve-
tamur: sefacere. — ultro et citro: here = ‘mutually’, as in the
common phrase data ultro citroque fide (Liv. 29, 23, 5). — cursu:

863. una: by attraction for unum (⁴ the one thing’; for this usage
see nn. on 50 qui, 18 eam. — quamquam: elliptic, the full sense
being ‘most men agree about virtue yet etc! - multis: chiefly the
Epicureans. — quam multi etc.: not exactly in accord with 63 ubi
eos inveniemus etc. Observe quam multi; no good writers use quet
as a substantive. So in 57 quam multa. Cic. however often prefers
to use quam neulti, tam multi where quot, tot would be permissible; so
35 haec ita multa quasi sata. — ad unum: ‘to a man ’. — et ei
.‘..et ei: those who follow the πολιτικὸς βίος and those who follow
the θεωρητικὸς βίος. One of the main questions which divided the
later Greek philosophers was that of the comparative value of these

two lives. Cf. n. on ro leuius facta etc. — otiosi: here, as often,
implies merely the freedom from public duties; cf. 16. -vitiam
esse nullam: for the phrase cf. n. on 22 uita vitalis,· for this Epicu·
rean opinion cf. n. on 56. - liberaliter: = libero degne: cf. 89.

’ 87, serpit: n. on 41. -— Timonem: the misanthrope (μισάνθρω-
πος) a contemporary of Socrates, the subject of Shakspere’s well·
known play. He is also the subject of one of Lucian’s most famous
dialogues. - nescio quem: Cicero often inserts quidam, nescio
quir and the like, when it is necessary, in mentioning some Greek, to
avoid the appearance of too great a familiarity with Greek literature.
The Roman statesmen of the dialogue could not be presumed to know
Timon except by vague report. In telling a story of Xenocrates to a
Roman jury (who objected to Greek learning in an advocate), Cicero
calls him quidamtBatb.§12); so of the Stoics non nulli litteris ac
studiis doctrinae dediti (Balb. §rh Nescio quem here has the same
purpose as ut opinor below, 88. Cf. n. on 24 doctum quendam also
ref. on C. Μ. 82 nescio quo modo. -- possit: potential subjunctive.
