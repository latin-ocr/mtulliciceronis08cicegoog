Greek and Roman menos letters. Hellenism had been power-
iul lor several generations in Latin literature and social lii . ln
the Hellenism of the Scipionic circle, however, not only were
old tendencics quickened, but a new and important influence
was added, that of the Greek philosophy. Although the wis-
dom of the Greeks was known in part to the Romans at a much
earlier time, its practical power over thern dates irom the famous
Athenian embassy of 1 ς 5 Β. c. composed os the three great phi·
losophers, Carneades the Academic, Diogenes the Stoic‚ and
Critolaus the Peripatetic. Alter this time all the Greek systems
struck root at Rome, but by far the greatest influence was ex·
erted by Stoicism, oi which nearly all the members oi Scipio's
society had a tincture more or less strong. Thus Scipio himseli
was devoted to the society of the Stoic philosopher Panaetius ;
Laelius had learned Stoicism from both Panaetius and Diogenes.
There are many tinges of Stoicism traceable in our dialogue.
These noble Romans, however, adopted the Stoic philosophy
more on account of its utility in supplying a foundation lor
theories oi law and government than as a form of laith. The
Stoicism they proiessed was also a Stoicism deprived of its
paradoxes and specially adapted to Roman tastes. ln this
sorm it ultimately exercised a proiound influence on the na-
tional lile os Rome.

Though the prevalent bent ol the Scipionic circle was towards
Stoicism, it was iar lrom rejecting the society oi those who
adhered to other systems. Thus Clitomachus the New Aca·

demic‚ was the iriend of many Romans of high station in his time.
On the literary side the circle os Scipio and Laelius was strong.

To it belonged Polybius, the great historian, Lucilius the satirist,
and the dramatists Terence and Pacuvius, with many others
scarcely less distinguished. We cannot here give any detailed
account of the persons who formed this brilliant society, but
must confine ourselves 'to suehiulormation¹ as is necessary to
illustrate the Laelius.
