48 noras To Laeuius [6

— modo: ‘a little while since'; the expression is somewhat loose
since Cato died in 149 Β. e.; cf. the use oi nuper in 13, 24· Cf. n. on
C. M. ²7· — L. Acilium: supposed to be the person mentioned
by Cic. Leg. 2, 59 as a commentator on the ΧΗ tables, and probably
a contemporary of Cato. By some he is thought to be the person
named by Liv. 40, 31, 1 as commander of the lelt wing of the Roman
army at the battle of Aebura in 181 uc. Some read in our passage
L. Atilius, a name about which nothing is known. — uterque: sc.
sapiens appellatus est or habuit hoc nomen sapientis. - alio quodam
modo: ‘in a somewhat different way' ς supply in thought atque tu.
Cf. 2 5 aliud quoddam ; 7 and 74 alio quodam modo. Quidam (like
quasi in 3l'is often used to indicate that the word to which it is at-
tached does not actually represent the writer's meaning. In the pas·
sages quoted above praedam, quoddam etc. indicate that alio, aliud etc.
are too strong ior Cicero's meaning. On the other hand, in 29, 45,
75, 59 the parts of quidam used show that Cicero cannot find terms
strong enough, and that the terms used are only make-shifts. The
indefinite ele is used in the same two ways in Greek. -prudens
in iure: Seyffert rightly points out that Cic. does not use prudens
with a genitive. The phrase iuris prudens (for iuris peritus or con·
tultus) is not Latin, though iuris prudentia occurs, as in De Or. 1,
256, and though jurisconsults are styled prudentes. Cic. has impru-
dens with gemin De Inv. a, 9 5„ also prudens ad in pro Font. 43; and
prudentia often both with gen. and with in and abl. See ,Holland
Jurisprudence, page 2, with notes and references—multarum
rerum usum: ‘a manilold experience ’. Liv. 39, 40,4 says of him
nulla ars neque probatae neque publicae rei gerendae ei definit. —
multa eius . . . terebantur: ‘many instances where both in the senate
and in the iorum he displayed either wise ioresight, or firm conduct,
or shrewdness in reply, were on every tongue’. The chief reference
in responsa is to Cato's lame as a lawyer. According to old Roman
custom he sat at home in the early morning. on purpose to resolve
the legal difficulties of all who chose to consult him. This was tech-
nically called ius respondere. — quasi: ‘almost'; cf. n. on 3. —-
' iam: ie. even before his death—sapientis: the Latins said
nomen institiae, nox fortitudinia, appellatio prudentis etc. where we use
apposition-‘the name justice ', ‘the word courage’, ‘the title skil-
tul ’. Α. 214,s; G. 3 593 H. 396, VI. Cf. 92 atamen amicitiae, and for ¹
the sense C. M. 5 sapientiam ...cognominet Note that the same term
