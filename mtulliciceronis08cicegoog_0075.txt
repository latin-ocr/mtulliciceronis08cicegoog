55 noros ro inscius [12

ι’. e. death so sudden as his3 for the form of expression cf. n. on 4. —
vere: there is a loose contrast with dffcile dictu est, which implies
nihr'l veri potest dici. - celeberrimos: not ‘most famous’ but
(literally) ‘most attended by crowds', ele. days on which Scipio was
the centre of the popular interest. Cf. Reid’s n. on Arch. 4 —·
clarissimum: for the application of clarus to things as well as
persons, N'agelsbach quotes Div. 2, 853 Att. 6, 1, 22 clarissimi iuris
iurandi. Notice the emphasis given by the repetition of diem from
diebus. —reductus est: it was the custom in times of excitement
for leading statesmen to be escorted to the senate-house from their
homes and back again by their admirers. For the escort away from
home deducere is generally used, for the escort homewards reducere.
See C. M. 63, where the two words occur together, as they do in
Val. Marc 2, 1, 9. For the mood see A. 336‚b; G. 630, Rem.1; H.
524, 2, 2). — ad vesperum: with the prepositions ad, neb, in, the
accusative of vesperis generally used and not that of vespera. --
populo Romano: simply=clvibus‚ the burgesses, as opposed to
the socii and Latini. — sociis et Latinis: these two words must
be taken together as forming one member of the enumeration, par·
allel with patribus conscriptis and populo Romano. When an enumer-
ation consists of only two members Cicero, except in certain special
cases, never omits the copula; when there are three or more mem·
bers, he either puts et before each member after the first or leaves it .
out altogether. In our passage, if socier and latinis had each of
them been entitled to rank separately in the enumeration, it would
have been necessary to strike out et. Madvig has most thoroughly
discussed this matter in a note on Fin. 4, 56 and in Opuscula 1,
p. 333 seq. The practice of most other writers of the best period
agrees on the whole with that of Cicero in this respect. 'ct n. on
⁴84. —— superos ...deos .. . inferos: the word deos is purposely not
placed immediately after superos, in order to prevent the reader from
understanding inseras to mean inferos deos. With this arrangement
superos, .. deos means, as Seyffert explains it, superi, qui dei sunt.

13. nuper: not quite accurate (cf. 24, n. on C. M. 61, also on modo
in 6) inasmuch as the knowledge of the Greek speculations which
denied the soul's existence after death had begun to spread among the
educated classes at Rome long before Scipio's death. The reference
is chiefly, but not solely, to the Epicureans Some of the Peripatetico
and some also of the new Academics held or at least sometimes
