Eth. Nic. 4, 3, 35. — eum:=talem airum. — ille: referring to
the same person to which eum refers. Had illc been left out the sub·
ject otest might have been taken to be amicus supplied from amici iu
the preceding clause. It was necessary therefore to insert a pronoen,
and according to Latin usage the change from eum to ille was uecdede
to repeat is would have been unusual. The following examplcs are
precisely similar: Sest. 7 et ad eum filiam aius adduxit, ut ille
aliquam partem maeroris sut deponerem Prov. Cons. 1 quartam me

So alate and ἐκεῖνος often refer (in the same sentence) to the same

the Rhetoric well, probably took it) and Diog. Lacrt. r, 87, but to
Chilon, another of the Seven, by Gellius, Noct, Att. 1, 3, 30. The
sentiment was put by Sophocles into the mouth of Ajax (see nn.
