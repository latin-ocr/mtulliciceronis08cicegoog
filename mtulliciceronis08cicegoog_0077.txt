on C. M. 3 ceteris. - idem semper, animos etc: Cic. is think·
ing of Socrates as he appears in the dialogues of Plato, particularly
in the Phaedo, Apology, Phaedrus, and Timaeus. The principal
arguments in favor oi the soul’s immortality which are put into
Socrates’ mouth in the Phaedo are many times reproduced by Cic·
ero, especially in Tusc. 1, Somn. Scip. and Cato Maior. In the
words esse ds'vinos and reditum ἐκ caelum patere Cic. recalls those
arguments in favor ot the soul's pre-natal existence which the Pla-
tonic Socrates usually joins with his arguments ior the soul’s life
alter the death oi the body. —ex corpore: used ior corporibus,
since in both Greek and Latin, when a number oi persons are men·
tioned and then some one thing common to them all, that thing is
¹ often put into the singular, where our idiom would require the plural.
cf. Tusc. 1, 40 animos, cum e corpore excesserint ,· ib. 1, 72 animorum
ecorpore excedentium C. M. 813 on the other hand, C. M. 80
ans'mos, dum in corporibus essent etc. — optimoque... expeditis-
simum: ct. Tusc. 1, 4ο sea: also Plato, Phaedo 114⁸· On the
superlative with quisque see A. 93, c; G. 3053 H. 458, 1.

14. praesagiret: on this word ci. Cic. Div. 1, 65 sagire enim sen·
tire acute cst: ex quo sagae anus quia netellam scire volunt, et sagaces
dicti canes. Is egitur qui ante sagit quam oblata res est dicatur prae·
sagr’re, r'd est, sutura aute scire. — Philus: see Introd. p. v. —-
Manilius: see Introd. p. v. - triduum disseruit: the discourse
is represented by Cicero’s work De Re Publica. — de re publica:
‘concerning the commonwealth’, i. e. the ideal or best iorm of com-
monwealth. — extremum: this neuter adj. is used as a noun ire·
quently by Cic. as below, zo, Div. 2, 91 and103; also by Lucr.
1, 960, Livy, Tacitus, etc. — tuit de: ‘treated ot '. — animo·
rum: the plural where we use the singular, ‘the soul '‚ in the abstract
sense. Immortalitas animorum also occurs in C. M. 78 where see n,
Ieg. 2, 68; aeternitas animorum in Tusc. 1, 80. — quae: as only
the last book of the De Re Publica (comprising the Somnium Scipi-
onis) discussed the immortality oi the soul, the neuter quae refers not
to the whole work, but merely to the extremum. Quod would have
been correct but inelegant. Quae is a sort of explanation oi extre·
reram ‘the conclusion, Ι mean such matters as ’. F or the plural tela·
tive referred to a singular antecedent cf. the not uncommon phrases
ex eo gessere quae (Fin. 3, 70) and ex eo numero qui with plural verb
(Arch. 31). T he usage rs frequently found in Greek, as Plato, Rep. 5 54
