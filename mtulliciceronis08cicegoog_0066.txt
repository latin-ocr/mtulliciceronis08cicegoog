a] worss ‘ro Lartius. 47

reference is made to some particular passage. Roby, 1177 ; G. 385,
Rem.; H. 425, 2, n. 1. With leuc libre here ci. C. M. 54 e'n ee libre.
—scripsi de amicitia: it is not often that Cic. leaves out the
object after scre'bere,· above in 4 aliquid is added. Sometimes a
qualifying adverb takes the place ol the object, as Att. 9, 15, 5 qued
scre'bls me asperius quom enei patiantur mures de Dionysio scripsisse.
Here the phrase ael amicum amicissimus sottens the construction.
Cf. however Fam. 9, 16, ι, 14, 2, 4. - senior...excellens: no
tice the order of the phrases, sape'ens corresponding with prudentior,
and senior with amicitiae gloria excellerem an instance of chiasmus.
-tu velim...avertas: on uelim see A. 311, b; G. ²503 H. 486,
I. n. 1. When Cic. uses the subjunctive construction atter uolo he
nearly always leaves out ut, as here. A. 331& Rem.; G. 546,
Rem. 33 H. 499, 2. The subject oi the dependent verb, il expressed,
always precedes the words uelim, uellem, malim and the like, asin
the present passage 3 ct. also Tusc. 5, 20 nes uellem praemio elicere
possemus, and Fam. 15, 3, 2. — Laelium...putes: the omission
of a conjunction to connect two clauses is particularly common in
Cic. when two clauses are contrasted‚ as here and below, ab tris sernw
eriteer, respondet Laelius ; cf. 49, 69; 13, 19, 22, 90.

P. 3. - disputatio: here not ‘discussion ’, but merely ‘discourse';
ci. De Or. 2, 233 disputes quid sentias,· also n. on 4. —te ipse
cognosces: ‘you will recognize your own likeness’. Ci. 10, me ipse
consolor,· also 59, 80. In these places ipse, not prum, is put for em·
phasis, because there is an implied contrast between the subject oi
the verb and other persons, so that ipse: eal airlr; here ‘you your·
seli, as well as others ’. Cf. C. M.4 a se ipsi andn. A. 195,lr; G.

2983 H.452, 1.

For summary see introd. p. ix.

fi sunt ista: ‘what you say is true'; sunt iste (ἔστι ταῦτα) and
sunt ista uera are almost equivalent expressions. The phrases este
(⁸be it granted’j and verum erte are frequently interchanged, as in ¹
Cic. Flacc. 71, 72, 95- existimare... existimant: the repetition
is a mark ot careless writing. —oculos...coniectos: the cause is
given at the end oi 7. —hoc: τ’. e. ut sepr'eus et appellaretur et
existimaretur. For the tense ol tribuebatur see n. on 37 cedebamus.
