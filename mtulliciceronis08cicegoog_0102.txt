41] noras ro carmus. 83

was a son of a daughter of the elder Africanus, therefore a cousin of
the Gracchi. The senate gave him a legatia 'to Pergamus, a form of
honorable exile, in order to withdraw him from the iury of the demo-
cratic party. He committed suicide at Pergamus—effecerint:
Seyffert rightly points out that fecerint could not stand here, since the
democratic party had not itself done anything to Nasica, but had
forced the senate to punish him. — non queo: n. on 22; ci. also n.
on 71 queant. — narn: this is elliptic, as often; so γάρ in Greek.
The lull sense would be ‘I need hardly mention Carbo, for eto' —-
quocumque modo potuimus: ‘we‘ here=the aristocratic party.
—propter poenam: i. e. it would have excited the populace too
much to attempt to punish Carbo so soon atter Ti. Gracchus' death.
— sustinuimus: ‘we have borne with '. — C. Gracchi autern:
but in 69 Q. vcro Maximum. The latter collocation is regular: here
autern is put after in order to make the contrast between Ti. Gracchi
and C. Gracchi more striking. - tribunatu: still in the future at
the time when Laelius is supposed to be speaking; Scipio died in 129
and C. Gracchus did not become tribune till 123 rac— serpit:

ci. 87. Serpere means here ‘to make progress imperceptibly or in· ·

sinuatingly’. Nagelsbach, Stilistik §129, has brought together a
good many instances oi this use, and ol other'words or phrases simi-
larly used, as manare, fundi, fluere, often with lange and late. For
serpere cf. Fin. 5, 65 caritas...rcrpc't sensim ib. 2, 45 hama profectus a
caritate darnesticarum et suarum serpit langius ,· N. D. 3, 51 illa autem,
Balbe, quac tu a caclo astrisque ducebas quana lange serpant, nan vides?
— serpit...labitur: general in scope, and intended to give the
reason why Laelius dreaded to think ot the future course of Gaius
- Gracchus. Deinde here is used proleptically, ie. it presupposes
semel which comes alten cf. n. on 7 reliqua. The sentence aaut. ..
Cassia simply gives an actual example of this general principle. —-
proclivis: see ref. on C. M. 38 frequens. — coepit: sc. labi. The
omission of the infinitiva is exceedingly common with both caepi and ,
debeo. Cf. Cat. 1,10 perge qua caepisti. Observe that Cic. ancl Cae·
sar do not, as Sallust, Livy, and later writers, use caepi absolutely ;
i. c. an infinitive is always either expressed or implied -- in ta·
bella: ‘in the matter of voting'; lit. ⁴ ot the voting ticket '. For the
collocation in tabella quanta sit cf. 24 deamicitia quid sentirem. —
iam ante: i. e. before the time oi C. Gracchus. - labes: ‘corrup
tion ’, i. e. of old institutions. —Gabinia lege: this law, entitled dc
