important place in the moral systems oi the ancients. ln post-
Platonic times especially. after the freedom of Greek political
lise was extingdislred and menos culture had to find private
outlets ior their energy, was Friendship brought into promi·
nence. Numerous treatises were specially devoted to it.¹ A
separate dialogue was given to it by Plato, viz. the Lyso, and
two whole books oi the Nicomachean Ethics (v111. and lx.) by
Aristotle. ln the Laelius, however, the range of questions dis-
cussed is lar narrower than was commonly the case with the
Greek philosophers who wrote on the subject The Greek
φιλία included every form oi associadon, even the relations of
man to man, of citizen to citizen, of purchaser to buyer, and the
like. Cicero, however, uses amicitia in a sense which is almost
exactly that oi the English ‘frzkndrhipt Nor does he attempt
that exhaustive discussion of all questions which had been raised
or might be raised touching F riendship in this narrower sense,
which we find in the two above-mentioned books oi the Nicoma-
claeon Ethics. The practice of friendship is discussed almost to
the exclusion of its theory. Cicero's treatise is indeed a kind
of popular essay‚ dealing with those aspects ot the subject which
could best be made interesting to readers in general. Again
and again during the course ot the dialogue he emphasizes the
practical character of the treatise. lndeed to have made it
highly speculative would have ill suited the characters oi the
interlocutors.
