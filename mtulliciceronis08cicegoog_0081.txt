De Or. r, 1023 ib. 3, rep—quamvis subitot=tam orbito quam-
vis. —magnum opus est: so in De Or. 1, 103 Cicero says of
Gorgias permagnum quidem suscipere ar prefileri addebatur. For mag·
num opus=a great rask, cl. Academ. 2, 1213 Tusc. 3, 79 and 84;
Orat. 75. - quae possunt: this refers to Fannius' words above
de aner'citriz disputaris. There is a contrast between disputari and
hortari,· Laelius at first declares himself unable to give a scientific
and philosophical discussion oi friendship; he can only give some
practical directions conceming it. — censeo petatis: petatis is

⁴ directly dependent on censeo, ut being suppressed, as it often is with

curo, caveo, sinere, bertari, and many other verbs; cf. n. on iocoue.
— anteponatis etc.: for the sense cf. 104. -nihil est enim:
note enim, third word in the clause; had it stood second est would
not have been so emphatic. — tam naturae aptum: the phrases
naturae aptus, ed naturam aptus are common in Cic. (as Fin. 4, 463
Off. 1, 100) and are of Stoic origin. The Stoics defined virtue as
being τῇ φύσει ὁμολογουμένως ζῆν, naturae corevenrenter vivere. Cf.
below 19 naturam optimam berre vehendi duran. — vel secundas
vel adversas: so Cic. says of literature (Arch. 16) secundas res
meant, adversis perfugium ac selectum praebent.

ta nisi in bonis: ‘except in the case of good men ’. Cf. 65,
where inter bonos corresponds to in benis here. — neque ...reseeoz
‘nor do I probe the question to its roots'‚ i. e. the question whether
only good men can be friends. The Stoics had declared that only
perfect men (sapientes, copel or σπουδαῖοιεύοηί, since none but the
σοφός is σπουδαῖος) could be friends. So Diog. Laert. 7, 124 τὴν
φιλίαν ἐν μόνοις τοῖς σπουδαίοις εἶναι λέγουσι, aud Aristotle Eth. Nic.
8 and opassim ; also Socrates in Xen. Mem. 2, 6, 20. The phrase
ad vr'vum resecare, literally ‘to cut back to the quick', is here iden-
tical in meaning with the subtilius disserere that follows, and with the
subtilius quaerere of 7. — sed ad ete: sc. disserunt. — sit ita
sane: this is a common formula aegre concedentis. So Academ. 2, 84
ne sit sane,· ib. 2, 105 sint salsa sane. — eam ...interpretanturt
sc. esse (ci. 50, 64); ‘they understand wisdom to be a thing which... ’ς
eam is by attraction for id. Α. 195, d: G. 202, Rem. 5; Η. 445, 4.
nemo: cf. 7 and 9. The leading Greek Stoic philosophers hardly
ever ventured to point out any actual person as having attained to
wisdom. Posidonius (Diog. 7, 94) seems to have allowed that Soc-
rates, Diogenes, and Antisthenes had made some advance towards
