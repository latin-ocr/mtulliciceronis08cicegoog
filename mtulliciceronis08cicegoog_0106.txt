48] nores ro LAELIUS. 37

25 eumpse. - multis locis: not different in sense from 48 multis
in rebus. For locis ci. 22 nullo loco, pluribus locta—consenta-
neum: ‘consistent’, i. e. ‘with your other actions'. — rem: =
τρᾶγμα; actionem: πρᾶξιν ‘course of action’. —- fugimus: ‘in-
tend to avoid’; the continuous sense oi the present tense frequently
borders on a future meaning. —- aspernetur: sc. ut. — bonitas:
‘kindheartedness'3 little different irum benevolentto in 19—- ma-
litiam: ‘evil-heartedness’‚ ‘ill-will'. —- temperantia: σωφροσύνη,
‘seli-control'‚ particularly with regard to bodily pleasures. — vi·
deas: see rei. on 5 velint. — modestus: not ‘modest ', but ‘law-
abiding ’3 here almost equivalent to our ‘respectable '.

48 cadit in: ‘belongs to ’‚ ‘affects’‚ ‘falls within the province
of ’3 a favorite phrase with Cic-3 e. g. Acad. 1, 423 Tusc. 3, 12 cadere,
opinor, in sapientem aegritudinem tibi dixisti videri ,· below, n. on 100.
-’- aliquas: note the difference to the sense which ullos ior aliquas
would make—the difference between getting rid oi some actual
troubles (aliquas) and all possible troubles (ne...ullos). —

’ motu animi: to be taken in a wide sense, as the context shows, both

oi emotions and oi intellectual perceptions. The Stoics taught that
the wise man should be absolutely unaffected by emotion‚ which they
regarded as sinful. Ci. Tusc lv, passim. Cf. non 10 incommodis.
- dico: this has ior its real object the whole phrase inter pecudem
etltonnitem, which may be treated as though between inverted com·
mas, as also the whole phrase irorn inter hominem to ciusdem. Some·
times Cic. uses non duam ior non dico in such sentences. Ci. also n.
on ne dicam in 82. -- truncum aut saxum: Cicero was no doubt
thinking when he wrote this oi the line in the Odyssey (19, 163) οὐ
’γὰρ ἀπὸ δρυός ἐσσι παλαιφάτου, οὐδ’ ἀπὸ πέτρης, which he imitates also
in Acad. 2,101. For truncus ci. N. D. 1, 84 qui potestesse in eins
modi trunco sapr'entiot— isti: the Stoics. — quandam: oiten
used withan adjective to soiten the statement. H. 456, 2. cl. iu
Greek the use oi τὶς σε in Xen. Mem. r,3, 12 ὡς δεινήν τινα λέγεις
δύναμιν τοῦ φιλήματος εἶναι. - volunt: n. on 293 also volt esse in
98. — cum...turn: ⁴as...so'. — bonis...incornmodis:=re-
bus secunai's...ndversis in 17. — diffundatur: sc. virtus, put here,
atter Cicero's iashion, for vir praeditus virtute. When the mind is
exponded it is supposed to feel pleasure, when contracted, pain. The
Stoics used the terms διαχεῖσθαι and συστέλλεσθαι, διάχυσις and ou
στολή. - non... repudientur: the sentence is elliptic for uon plus
