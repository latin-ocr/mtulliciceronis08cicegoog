50 N OTES TO LAELIUS. [7

had been enjoined on him by the Delphian god uel ἐκ μαντείων καὶ
ἐξ ἐνυπνίων. The Scholiast on Aristophanes' Nubes 114 gives there
the actual words of the answer to Chaerephon: σοφὸς Σοφοκλῆς,
σοφότερος δ’ Εὐριπίδης, ἀνδρῶν δ’ ἁπάντων Σωκράτης eupompus. The
latter of the two lines is also preserved by Diogenes [laertius 2, 5,
ς 37. Cic. speaks in four other passages ot the oracle, viz. Lael. 10 '

and 13, Cat. M. 78, Academ. 1, 16. —— omnia...esse: the Stoic .
doctrine is here hinted at, that virtue is the only thing deserving the , ,

name of good, and that the happiness of the truly wise man is ab·
solutely unaffected by external circumstances. People were curious ,
to see whether Laelius would try to carry out his philosophy, and
to appear careless about the death ot his friend. Cf. n. on C. M.4
quimpetunt — virtute inferiores: ‘of less importance than vir·
tue ’. This (see preceding n.) is not strong enough to express the

, Stoic doctrine. — credo: merely parenthetic, and without influ-

ence on the construction. The verb to be supplied for this clause
is quaeruut, not quaerere. — hoc: ‘our friend here’ ; so 3²· --

quonam pacto: lit ‘on what conditions', pactum ( peruror) being '

properly something agreed on between two persons. The phrase
came to be used in exactly the same sense as quouom modo ; cf. 4
nescio quo pacto with 89 nescro quo modo. —eoque magis: sc.
quaerunt. The sentence from quod onwards is explanatory of ro,
which is the ablative of excess dependent on magu. — proximis:
‘the last ’. Proximus is used both oi the future and of the past. Oc·
casionally a word is inserted to define the meaning more nearly, as
Fam. 1, 9, 20 proximis superioribus diebus ; Tac. A. 1, 77 proximo
priore auno, and also when proximus is used oi space, as Cic Orat.
216 proximum superiorem pedem ,· N. D. 2, 53 proximum inferiorem
orbem. — Bruti: D. Iunius Brutus, sumamed Gallaecus from his
conquest of the Gallaeci‚ consul in 138 tac. He appears as augur
only in our passage. —commentandi causa: ‘with a view to

practice ’, i. e. iu the augural art. Commentariis properly ‘to con '

over a lesson’, μελετᾶν. For the custom cf. Cic. Div. 1, 90 divi-
nont Magi qui congregantur in sono commentandi causo atque inter se
colloquendi, quod etiom idem uos quondam secere Nonis solebatis. As
the augurs required lor their practice an open space whence they
could get an uninterrupted view oi the sky they usually met in some·

gentleman's park (horti) outside the city: cf. N. D. 2, rr. -qui
...solitus esses: ‘though you had been accustomed‘. For this
