92 NOTES TO LAELIUS. [54.

omuem ratzonem humanitatis? Cornif. ad Herenn. 4, 25 contrasts the

commodus with the uir intolerabili superbuit. — imperio potestate:
originally potestas at Rome had a very wide meaning, denoting all

power exercised by public authority and so including imperium. Then
as certain officcrs (consul, praetor, dictator) had imperium, while
others (censor, aedile, etc.) had not, the word poteslas came to be par·
ticularly used in connection with the latter class of officers. Trans.
‘by power and office ’. — sperni: the words fromsperm' to nmt's are
explanatory of immutari ; in such cases the connecting et is often leit
out-an usage called by grammarians asyndeton explicats'vum. On
novis (sc. atnt'citt‘is) dat. atter impers. passive, see Madvig, 244, b; A.
230; G. 208; II. 384, 5.

⁵⁵. copiis...opibus: ‘riches, resources, prosperity’; the three
words differ very little in meaning. Plurimum posse ‘to be very influ-
ential '. — cetera: proleptic.

P. 22. - amicos: adversative asyndeton. - ut ita dicam: Cic.
is apparently translating κτῆμα in such passages as Xen. Mem. 2, 4, 1
πάντων κτημάτων κράτιστον hv εἵη φίλος. For uts'ta dicam in a transla-
tion cf. n. on 49 redamare ; for the metaphor in supellex, Orat. 80 oratoriis
quasi supellex ; Sen. Ep. 58, 18 ideae, proprs'a Platonis supellex ,· Acad.
2, 31 and Sen. Ep. a, 5, 8 vitae instrumentum. — eius: A. 214, ις
G. 365, Il. 402, 403. - istorum : :istarum rerum. — vicit vi-
ribus: the alliteration is evidently intentional; cf. Mil. 30 vl victa vis,
also Lael. 45. — sed haec hactenus: a common formula for wind·
ing up one subject and passing on to anothcr; ‘but enough of this’.
So Fam. 6, 2, 3.

⁵6. constituendi sunt etc: lor constituendum est etc. by attraction
to the construction of the clause qui sint etc. Cf. 63 perspiciuntur
quum sint leves; also n. on 35 deserere, and De Or. 2, 137 quaeruntur
qualia sint ; ib. 2433 N. D. 2, 115. Madvig on Fin. 5, 58 says this
kind of attraction is used only by Cicero. - fines et quasi termini:
finis was very commonly used in the metaphorical sense, terminus less
commonly3 hence the quasi. — diligendi: beware oi taking this as
nom. pl. — video: See n. on 39 videmus. —terriz ‘are usually
stated '. ef. 6 struebantur. —unamt this was an opinion which
thc Epicureans managed to entertain. Though they based friendship
on utility (Diog. Laert. 10, 120) still they said that the tull benefrt of
friendship would not be reaped unless a man loved his friend just as
himself. Cf. Fin. 1, 68 quocirca eodem modo sapiens erit affectus erga
