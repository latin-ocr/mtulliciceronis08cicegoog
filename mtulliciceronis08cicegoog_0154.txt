The Washington (liobe-By the common consent of all critics, this is
the best work on Democracy in ancient or modern literature. It has had
the universal good fortune to please men of all shedes ot political opinion,
for the simple reason that, being the work of a man who strove to attain the
just medium in all his opinions, who was a sincere seeker after truth, and
whose chief aim in life was the good of mankind, it bears throughout strong
marks of impartiality, sincerity, and honesty.

The N. Υ. Tribunc. -The more it is studied‚ the more reason one will
find to admire the philosophical spirit which pervadet every part, without
being anywhere offensively obtruded; its luminous method; the accurate
knowledge of our institutions' which it resecis alike in their spirit and in their
details; and the accuracy‚ clearness, and grace of the style. . . . Professor
Bowen has subjected Reeve’s version to a careful supervision‚ and has
almost rewritten it. lle has made it more correct aud more compact by
lopping off its redundency end tightening its structure, so thst it not only
better represents de Tocqneville, but it is better English.

The National Quartcrly Review.- De Tuoqueville has become e classic
in every literature iu Christeudom. His Democrocy in Americo is everywhere
recognized asa standard authority. True, he wrote this work thirty years
ago: at least a score have been written on the same subject siuce; but his
is worth five score. Yet it is a remarkable fact that the one now before us
is the only edition iu English which is st ah northw oi ine numum a& We
subject which hs handles with such masteriy ak'hh
