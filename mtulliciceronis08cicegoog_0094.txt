30] NOTES TO LAELIUS. 75

1, 1, 60 hicmarus aheneus esto nil conscire sibi, nullo pallescere aspa.
- nullo: Cic. uses the abl. and gen. oi nullus as substantives, to
replace the abl. and gen. oi sumo, which were not in use. He avoidS,
however, the use oi nullus, nulli, nullum as substantives, and even
prefers nemo homo, sapiens etc. to nullus horno etc. Nor does Cic.
write nulli (nom. plur.) by itseli, since nemo expresses the same
sense. Generally the Republican and Augustan writers agree with
Cic. in his treatment oi nemo and nullus. See Madvig, 913 G. 304,
end; H. 457, 2. - suaque etc: ior the sense ci. 7. For que see
n. on 21 virosque. — quid enim? Like our exclamation ‘why‚
nowl' - Africanus indigens: the σοφός or sapiens oi the Stoic
system was αὐτάρκης, sufficient ior himself. Chrysippus (Seneca
Ep. 9) drew a fine distinction, that there was nothing the wise man
needed, though there were many things it was advisable ior him to
have-nullo re indigere ettamen multis illi rebus opus esse. Ci.
Plato, Lysis 21 5 Β. - indigens: the omission both oi an interrog·
ative particle and oi erat renders the question more emphatic. —-
ac: ‘and assuredly'; ac or atque at the outset oi a sentence often
introduces a statement emphatically. Cic. and the other writers oi
the best period never use nec...quidem, the place oi which is oiten
taken by ae, or et, or atque iollowed by ne...quidem. - ego: se.
dilexi, to be supplied from dilexit. Cf. Phil. 2, 38.—virtutis
eius: the use oi a genitive dependent on another is communest in
. Cic. when, as here, the dependent genitive is a pronoun. cf. 37
illius suroris. ,- opinione...habebat: a somewhat roundabout
mode oi expression. Ci. Att. 7, 2, 5 de opinione et sep—for-
tasse non nulla: mark the show oi modesty. —habebat...di·
lexit: the change ostense should be observed3 the imperfect denotes
that Africanus was some time in coming to his conclusions about
Laelium dilexit points to the moment his decision took effect. —·
multae et magnae: when two adjectives are in agreement with the
same noun Cic. generally connects them with et, where English idiom
would often require them to be put side by side. When multus is
one of two adjectives the conjunction is rarely leit out (cf. Greek
usage -πολλὰ sol sord), but ii mullus is one oi three adjectives the
et sometimes disappears. Cf. Verr. 5, ¹¹9 mulii etgraves dolores,
but Fam. 5, 17, 3 multis fortissimis atque optimis viris ; Pro Imp. Cn.
Pomp. 6 multa...merona et greum bello. —causae diligendi: a
somewhat pleonastic phrase; it would have been enough to say that .
