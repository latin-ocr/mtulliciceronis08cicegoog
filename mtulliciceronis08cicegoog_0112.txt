58] NOTES TO LAELIUS. 93 “

ami'cum, quo r'u se ipsum also thewhole passage there from 65 to 70.
— alteram: this is the opinion of those who regard friendship as a
barter oi services; see below, 58. —pariter aequaliterque: u. on
32 pares etc. — quanti: see n. on 37 tanti.

⁵⁷. prorsus: goes with nulli, not with assentior; ‘to none at all ’.
—laceremus etc: tor the sense ef. 26. —causa amicorum:
the repetition of causa, which is often leit out in the second place, as
in 46, is no doubt due to the desire to complete the chiasmus. —
precari: note the omission of aliquid. —supplicare: sc. alicui. ·—-
acerbius invehi insectari vehementius: chiasmus—non satis:
‘not very '. — multaeque res sunt etc. ς not lor multaeque al iae
res sunt etc, but this clause repeats and gives more exactly the gen·
eral statement contained in the words queem multa...ame'corum. —
viri boni etc: it will be seen that in this section Cicero gives a pecu·
liar turn to the meaning ol the first opinion of the three above enumer-
ated. He takes it to imply that aman must always act with regard
to his friend just as he would in his own case, but the opinion itselt
probably had regard not to action but to feeling and implied that love
between friends should be equal. Itis in this sense that Cic. himself
understands the opinion in Tusc. 3, 73 praeclarum illud est et, si quae-
ris, rectum quoque et verum ut eosqui nobis carissimi esse debeant aeque
ae nosmet ipsos amemus. The opinion in fact was an answer to the
question discussed by Aristotle in Eth. Nic. 9, c. 8 πότερον δεῖ φιλεῖν
ἑαυτὸν μάλιστα ἢ ἄλλον τινά and in the words of the next clause it
definiebat amicitiam paribus voluntatibus.

⁵8. definit: ‘restricts friendship to an equal interchange of services
and leelings‘. - exigue et exiliter: ‘with minuteness and exact·
ness'. —- calculos: properly the pebbles used in the abams ior
counting3 here ‘to an account‘. Cf. foeneremur in 31.—ratio
acceptorum: cf. closely 26, 31. — datorum: the usual contrast to
acceptorum in the language ot Roman book-keeping is expensorum.
The phrase accepti experirique ναίὴ) ‘a debtor and creditor account' is
common. — divitior: Cic. uses this form, not ditior, and divitissi-
mus, not ditissimus. -— observare etc: Aristotle, Eth. Nic 8, 7 and
8, ¹3› 1 lays down that there is a class of friendships καθ’ ὑπεροχήν
where there cannot be an equal exchange oi services.

Ρ. 23. - acceperit: subjunc. with quam. A. 332, b; Η. 502, 2.
— neque enim eto: ie. il the friendship be true all such fears .
fall to the ground — excidat...defluat...congeratur: the meta· “
phors are all from measuring articles of commerce.
