15 namma misius habitu. — ea: sc. amicitia. not natura: illa would
have been clearer and more usual. -hoc e :hac re; ‘herein’.
— propinquitati: ‘relationship’, including the relationship oi
citizen to citizen as well as that oi the members oi a family one to
, another, — non potest: Latin idiom requires the repetition oi
the verb potest in the negative clause, where English idiom would
omit it.—propinquitatis: ior the omitted adversative particle
(sed or the like) cf. n. on 5 Laelium... putes.

20. res: as in 17. — duos: while duo lor duos is classical -
(Roby, Vol. 1, p. 4423 Kennedy, §33‚ V. 4)), the weight of MSS.
evidence is in favor oi duos as the Ciceronian form. — iungeretur:
on the tense see Α. 287, a; G. 511, Rern. ²3 H. 495, I.—enirn:
the conditions of amicitia here given are so difficult of fulfilmeut that
they account ior the rarity of caritas (as above inter duos autpaucos),
which is the keruel of friendship. -— omniurn...consensio: in
15 it is said that the whole pith (omnis m'r) of friendship lies in the
consensio voluntatum studiorum sententiarum. In the present passage
the objects towards which the voluntates, studia, and sententiae are
to be directed are so described as to include all things in heaven
and earth. The division of all things into res divinae and res liu-
manae belonged to everyday talk and has no reference to any philo·

Neither in Eth. Nic. Books 8 and 9, nor in Plato’s Lysis, is any
very exact definition of friendship attempted. — benevolentia et
caritate: ‘ldndliness and affection’. These words are often thus
joined, as in Sest. 6; Phila, 107and112; Off. r, 54. Cf. 32 benevo
letitiae caritatem. Cum benevolentia et caritate qualiiy consensio. --

haud scio au: in Cic. and the best writers this phrase is affirmative. -
