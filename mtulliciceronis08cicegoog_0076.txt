advocated the same views. - mortuis...iure: the principal ‘rev-
erent rites' paid to the dead are mentioned iu Cic Leg. 2, 55 seq. 3

cf. especially 57 oculta relegisse iura. The passage resembles Tusc.
’ r, 26 seq. - si...arbitrarentur: ci. Tusc r, 27. For the imper·
fect in arbitrarentur and haereret, modern feeling would require the
pluperlect. Cic. for the moment realizes the pastas present, and
so looks on the condition as not wholly past but still continuing.
The usage is like the substitution of the present for the past, for the
sake of vividness, in historical narratives. Often both protasis and
apodosis contain a verb in the imperfect where we should expect the
pluperfect (e. g. Verr. 5, 89; Sest. 63l; but it does not often happen
that the apodosis has a verb in the pluperfect, while the verb in the
protasis stands in the imperfect, as in C. M. 19 nisi essent...ap·
pell assent. irregularities of the same sort are common in Greek
conditional sentences. Α. 308, a, G. 599, Rem. 13 H. 510, n. 2. —·
nihil: adv. acc. with perferrem supply some word referring to iura
above. — ad eos pertinere: cf. Aristotle, Eth. Nic. r,10,3 δοκεῖ

runt. See n. on C. M. 21 sunt. The followers of Pythagoras are
meant. -— nunc quidem: ‘now, 1 admit’; for the concessive use
oi quidem cf. 74. - tum: some adversative particle (correspond
ing to sedantem vero or the like) would be inserted in any modern
language. This adversative asyndeton is especially common in Cae·
sar, as in B. G. 1, 18, 1 celeriter consilium dr'rnr'ttr't, Ltrcum retinet ;

P. n-ver eius: in C. M. 78 Cic. appeals just as he does here
to the Pythagoreans and to Socrates as authorities for the immortal-
ity of the soul. — qui: sc. dicebat. - non: supply quotiens de
hoc re diceret, — tum hoc tum illud: the later Academics, partic·
ularly Arcesilas and Cameades‚ professing to follow Socrates, made
a practice of arguing on both sides of every question, and declared
that certainty was nnattainable‚ though probable conclusions might
be formed. They prided themselves on not being obliged to support
dogmatically any set of views3 while others were in bondage to doc·
hines, they only w'ere free to put forward ‘now this now that '. Cf.
Cicero's Academica possim, but particularly 2, 134 tum hoc mihipra-
babr'lr'us, tum illud relietum 2, 121 modo hoc modo illud probabilius
videtum· N. D. r, 47 Cotta meus modo lroc modo illud. Cf. Intr.
