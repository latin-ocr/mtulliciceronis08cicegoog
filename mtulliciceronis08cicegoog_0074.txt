12] NOTES TO LAELIUS. 55

stood out with greater prominence and distinctness, would in fact
have been more emphasized; ct. n. on 95 inter. Scipio gave a
legacy to his mother aiter her divorce (pietate), bestowed it aiter her
death upon his sisters (liberalitate), and gave to his elder brother
property received from his father's estate (bonitate). — maerore:
dolor is griei as felt at the heart, luctus as expressed by material signs,
in the dress, ior instance, maeror as expressed by the condition or
action oi the sufferes, ior example by the gloom on his countenance.
The following is a striking passage-Art. 12, 28‚2 moerorem minui,
doloresit nec potiti nec si possem, vellem—quid: adv. acc.—
potuisset: A. 310, 03 G. 594, 33 ll. 507, 3, n. 7. — memini...dis-
serere: n. on 2. Laelius and Scipio are two ot the interlocutors in
the Cato Maior, and Cic. strives artiully here to give an air oi reality
to the conversation he relates in that dialogue - viriditatem:
‘treshness'. For the metaphorica] use oi the word ct. Verg. Aen.
6, 304 cruda deo viridisque senectus ‚¹ Tac. Agr. 29 iuventus et quibus
cruda ac viridis senectus; Verg. Aen. 5, ²95 viridique iuventa. —
etiam nunc: even in the best writers nunc occasionally goes with a
past tense, as Cic. Verr. 3, 47 quos ego campos antea nitidissimos vialis
sem, hos ita vastatos nrsnc videbam ut‚..1n that passage tum would
have been ambiguous atter antea, so in ours tum might have been
referred by the reader to the time of the conversation between Scipio,
Cato, and Laelius3 so in Liv. 3, 19, 8. But often the motive is
merely the desire to make the narrative vivid, as in Caes. Β. G. 7,
62, 6 incerto stunc etiam exitu...signa intulerunt‚· ci. ib. 6, 4ο, 6;
Cic. Cat. 1, 9; Sallust, lug. 109, 3.

12 vita...gloria: Cic. means that some would look on Scipio's
liie as merely showing the effect of luck or chance, while others would
think oi the renown attending it and assume that Scipio deserved it.
Gloria here implies virtus. Fortuna and virtus are the two important
attributes ot the Roman general; ci. Pro Balbo 9 (of Pompeius) in
quo uno ita stemma fortuna cum summa virtute certamt utplus homini
quam deae tribueretur ; Fam. ιο, 3, 2 virtute duce, comite fortuna;
De Imp. Cn. Pom. 28. For the ablatives see Roby, 1210; A. 2 533
G. 3983 H. 424. —- accedere: sc. vel ad fortunam vel ad glorium.
—moriendi sensum: niorimdi is the act or process oi dying; '
mortis would have a different meaning and could not be substituted
here. Cf. C. M. 74; Phil. 9, 13 siquis estsensus in morte. On
Scipio’s death see Intr. to C. M. p. xxii. —- quo de genere mortis:
