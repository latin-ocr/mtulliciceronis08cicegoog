70 N OTES TO LAELIUS. [24

vaticinqri sometimes means ‘to prophesy', there may he a reference
to the fact that Empedocles claimed to possess prophetie and magic
powers. —totoque mundo: this is merely explanatory of rerum
natura, which has the same meaning, ‘in the constitution of things
and the entire universe ’. — constarent...discordiam: Empedo-
cles held that two principles were perpetually at war in the universe,
one the principle of love or friendship, attraction, constantly
tending to unite the scattered portions oi the tour elementS, five,
air, earth, and water, so as to bring things into existence, the other
the principle of hate or enmity, repulsion, tending to decompose
bodies into their constituent parts. ——eat object oi both the in·
finitives following. — hoc: ‘this principle ’, i. e. that friendship is

, a uniting force, hatred a destructive force. —omnes mortales:

here = simply omnes homines. Cicero never uses mortalis for homo
without some attribute, though the usage is very common in Sallust,
Tacitus, and the later Latin prose. Caesar altogether avoids the
word. Cr. mortalis nemo in 18. —— re probant: ‘approve by their

actions’. — siquando aliquod: Cicero, like the other Latin
writers, often seems capricious in his use of quando and aliquando,

quid (quod...) and aliquid (aliquod...) after sr'. It is commonly said
that when the words with ali· are used alter si they are more em·
phatic than the simple iorms; the passages, however, do not always
bear out the supposition. Ci. Madvig, 493, a, Obs. 1. -- adeun·
dis: i. e. pro amic0; in the one case the amicus meets the danger
alone, and protects his friend3 in the other both friends iace it
together. The use ofin is the same as that in 9 in pueris.—
M. Pacuvi: Pacuvius, the greatest tragic writer in Latin (summus
tragicus-Cic. de Opt. Gen. Dic. 2) was born at Brundisium about
220 and lived till about 130 u. c. See Sellar, Roman Poets ot the Re· ⁴
public, Ch. 5. Since Pacuvius probably exhibited no new play after

his eightieth year (Cic. Brut. 229), and Scipio died in 129 me, the ’

word nuper is very loosely used, as in 13. Pacuvius probably never
became a Roman citizen, hence Cic. calls him hospes as well as anrr'·
cus. So Fam. 9, 12, 2 hospiti reteri et arrrico (of king Deiotarus).
-- nova fabula: commonly supposed to be a play called the Du·
lorestes (though Ribbeck and some other scholars deny this), of
which a number of fragments are preserved. Ci. Fin. 5,63. The
story was often handled by Greek dramatists. The plays of Pacu-
vius were all palliatas and closely copied irom Greek originals, but it
