NOTES TO LAELIUS.

LAELIUS DE AMICITIA (Lar-:mus ou Frununswrey.
The main title is settled by Cicero’s own words in De Officiis
2, 9, 31 sed deamicitia ulio libro dictum estqui inscribitur
Laelius-‚¹ There are reasons, however, for supposing that the
author intended the treatise to bear also the secondary title, ΒΕ
AMicrrm. ln ξ ςζ addressing Atticus, he says ut tum ad senem
senex de senectute, sic hoc libro ad amicum amicissimus
scripsi de amicitia. In like manner the Cato Maior, thus
desIgnated in De Off. 1, 42, 151, and in AdAtt. 14, 21, 3, is
described in Dc Div. 2, 1, 3 as liberis quem...de senectute.²
So the MSS. give to the Brutus, called by this name in DeDiv.
2, r, 4, the second title De Claris Oratoribus. Such double
titles were not uncommon. They are frequently iound in an-
cient citations oi Plato's works and in MSS.; e. g. Φίληβος, περὶ
τάγαθοῦ. Varro also wrote agreat number oi books, called libri
logistorici‚ which took their first titles from the names oi per·
sons, their second titles from their subject-matter. We may
laitly conclude then that the proper complete title oi the dia·
logue is Lunnws nn Aureum.
