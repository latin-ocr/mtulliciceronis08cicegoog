Prot. charles Chandler, Derisor University, Granuille Otia-I consider
the Selactions to be an excellent and long-needed book. Ishall use it
more or less every term from the beginning of Freshman year. For reading
at sight it is just the thing tlvatI have wanted, and, in connection with the
study oi the development of Roman Literature, such a book will be highly
interesting and profitable. I have always maintained that it is a flat, stale,
and unprofltable task for the student to read about the productione oi Latin
authors,vvithont at the same time studying the productions themselves.

Proi. Tracy Peck, Yois Collega, Nero Hauon, Cone. - The plan seems to
ma to be carried out with excellent jndgment and taste. Thia work ccr-
tainly gives in succinet and attractiva form a olem vievv of Roman literature

throughout its best periods

rabie edition, and will be thoroughly helpful in the difficult work of devel-

and Conington, by the Rev. Semnan Hiar, M.A., Professor in
Trinity college, Hartiord. ldmo, 91 peges, 1015.

The text of this edition agrees in most places with that oi Jahn. In the
arguments prefixed to each satire, the editor has endearored to give a
suggestive outline oi the poet's thoughts, and in the notes, to point out aa

clearly as possible the connection oi one idea, or one part oi the poem, nith

another. 8
