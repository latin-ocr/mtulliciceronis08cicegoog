itseems tome, if not absolutely perfect, to approach as near perfectiori as
any text-hook I have ever examined. The introduction and colored platea
are invaluable as aids to a clear understanding 01 the text, and are superior
to anything oi the kind elsewhere. The maps, notes, vocabulary, and table
01 idioms are unsurpassed iu any text-hook 01 Caesar now in use.

adopt it.

the American student.
