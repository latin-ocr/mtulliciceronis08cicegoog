8] N OTES TO LAELIUS. 5¹

use of the suhj. with qui, to express an idea contrasting with, or op
posed to that of the preceding clause or sentence, cf. Brut. 127 hic,
qui in collegio sacerdotum esset, iudicia publico est condemnatus. Cf.
A. 3264 G. 6373 H. 515, 111.

ἃ C. Laeli: the addition of the praenomen, not usual in familiar
conversation, gives formality to the address: cf. roo. — animum
adverti: animum aduertere and animadvertere (cf. 27) differ very
little in use and not at all in sense. Animum advertere is said to
be necessary when the construction ad aliquid (to turn the mind to
something) follows. — cum...amicissimi: the⁴natural order
would have been viri cum summi tum amicissimi. A word however
which (liltevirr' here) stands in the same relation towards two other
words or phrases, is often placed thus between the two. The old
grammarians called this usage coniuncta,- cf. Cornificius Ad Heren-
nium 4, 38 coniunctio cst cum imerposiriane verbi et superiores orationis
partes comprehenduntur et inferiores, hoc modo: Formae dignitas aut
morbo deflorescit aut vetustate. G. 682; H. 564, I. II. —- moderate:
the StoicS, whom Laelius followed, declared all emotion vicious, and
therefore not to be entertained hythe philosopher either to a mod·
erate or to an immoderate extent3 see Tusc. Book 4, particularly
§42 nihil interest utrum moderatas perturbationes approbent an arode-

ratam iniustitiam, moderatam guentam, moderatam intemperantiam.
— nec...tuae: ‘and that to be solid) did not accord with your
cultured spirit ’.‘ Humanitas corresponds in sense almost exactly
with our ‘culture ', i. e. education when accompanied hy its best
fruits, gentleness and refinement.

P. 4.-quod etc: A. 333, ας G. 525, Rem. ²3 H. 540, IV. —-
collegio: ie. of augum—valetudinem: not to be translated
by ‘ill-health' or ‘sickness’‚ but simply by ‘health’, the English
word being just as undefined as the Latin, which receives its defini·
tion from the context; cf. 22. — maestitiam: this is the right
spelling, not maestitiam ,· so maestus not moestus, maereo not moereo.
- recte...et vere: sc. respondeas. - officio: corresponds to
mtrnus as usurpavi does to obire. Usurpare is to say or do some·
thing habitually or repeatedly‚ here ‘to perform regularly ’. Cf. 28.
- incommodo: note the slightness of the expression, as applied
to the death of avery dear friend, and cf. n. on to. - constanti
homini: ‘aman of strong character '. Constans homo (Horace's
iustus ae tenax propositi air) is opposed to mobiles in Qu. Rosc. 49:
