Haut. 5, 1, 73 d. luxuria et lascivia ; Tusca, 5² liquescimus fhcimus·
que mollitia ; Liv. 7, 29, 5 fluentes luxu ; also the phrase fluxa cor·
pora, and the uses of solvi, dtusolvi, frangi, debilitari and the like.
Dtffiuere is rather rare, not occurring in Caesar, Nepos, Vergil, Hor-
ace or Ovid, and only once in Cicero’s speeches. The homines meant
are ol course the Epicureans and Cyrenaics, as in 46. -habent
cognitam: see n. on C. M. 66 sollicitam habere. In such phrases we
have the first step towards the conversion ot habere into an auxiliary
verb, which is completed in the Romance languages, Cf. also 97 ex·
ploratum habeas. See Brachet, Historical French Grammar, Bk. a,
Part z. — ut: ‘on condition that ’, ‘so as neither to...' Cf. Aris·

ἀγαθά, Cicero’s words are so near to Aristotle’s as almost to look
like a translation. Nigelsbach 596, 2 points out that eie here is
trying to represent μήτε φιλῶν μήτε neuturus, and gives some in*
structive remarks on the modes in Latin oi replacing the present par·
ticiple passive. —circumfluere: Verr. 3, 9 istum rebus omnibus
aridique ereptis eludentem circumfluere atque abundare. —- nulla fides:
cf, Ennius, quoted in Off. 1, 26, Nulla sancta societas nec fides regni ,⁰
Luc. Phar. r, 92 Nullafides regni sociis ,· Bacon‚ Essay on Friendship
‘Princes cannot gather this truit' (oi iriendship). — benevolen-
tiae.. .fiducia: in the best prose writers fides and fiducia nearly always
take the objective genitive (‘ trust in '); the dative, however, is found
in the poets, as Verg. Aen. 3, 69 fides pelago ,· ib. ro,152 fiducia rebus.
Even with the phrases fidem facere, fiduciam facere, the construction
in good prose is generally alicuius rei, not alr‘cui rei.

⁵³. quis eminete: cf. Off. 1, 97 si Aeacus aut Minos diceret ‘ode-
rint dum metzunt’; Phil. r, 34 in fiebulis ipsi illi qui ‘oderint dum me-
tuant’ dr'arerit. — dumtaxat ad tempus: ‘but only ior a season’.
Dumtaxat in the best writers is merely corrective, introducing an ex-
ception upon some word or words preceding, here on coluntur. Tuxat
is probably a subjunctive ot the lost Latin aorist (here the weak
aorist) from tongere a form oi tongere (denten, ruint). Oscan formS,
tungrim-m, tunginod = scitum, scito (or iussu or decreto) are preserved.
The formation ot taxat will be then practically the same as that of
λέξῃ. For the dropping oi the nasal ci. rotyyu, ἔσφιξα; θιγγάνω, tito.
The original meaning of dumtaxat would thus be ‘provided one knows
the matter ’. The verb taxare is used only in late Latin. — ad tem-
