5²] NOTES' TO LAELIUS· 89'

is rare. —bonis inter bonos: more emphatic than bonai inter se‘,
which would have been more usual. —necessariamt sc. esse. -—
qui: the attraction ot the relative in sentences like this is almost regu·
lar in Cicero, and indeed in most other writers of the best period ;
e. g. Pis. 573 Phil. 5, 39 Pompm putre, quod impertit populi Romani
lumen fiat, exstincto. Cf. n. on 18 eam etc. - amicitiae fons:
cf. 32. — inhumana: ‘unkindly’; r'annrunis, ‘unserviceable’ (lit-
erally, free irum munio or duties towards the state); superba, ‘ego-
tistic’. The last word is difficuit to translate, as it combines the
notions ‘oppressive ’, ‘ proud', ‘difficult oi approach ’. — quac : =
cumea.

51. fingunt: as in 18 quae finguntur 41212ρί0240.- amabilis·
simum: n. on 4 maxime memorabilem.—- amor ipse: n. on 19
natura apsa — turn . . . si: cf. n. on 2 5. — ab amico est proiec-
tum: the word proficisci is often thus used in Cicero’s letters oi ser-
vices passing between iriends; e. g. Fama, 19‚2 quaecumque a me
ornamenta in teprqficiscentur ; ib. 3, 1, 1 ; so Nep. Att. 9, 4. - tan-
tumque abest ut...ut: this clumsy construction is avery favorite
one with Cic. Note that with all good writers the verb in such
phrases (abest, afuit etc.) is impersonal. See Madvig, 440, a and Obs.
13 A. 332, d; G. 556, Rem. r ; H. 502, 3. - indigentiam: a rare
word, scarcely occurring out of Cicero, who uses it above, 27, 29, and
Tusc. 4, 16 and 21. ——praesidiz cf. 46. - alterius: Cic. uses
r'urbgere far oftener with a genitive than with an ablative, though the
latter is commoner in silver Latin. cf. Roby, r334-5. - atquc: here
corrective=rralroa ‘and yet'. —hand sciam an: a well-attested
though rare variant for houd scio an; cf. Dc Or. 1, 2553 2, 72 and
209. On the mood of scium see references on 5 tu 021102- ne . ..
quidem: the reason for the negative will be seen by referring to n.
on 20 lrurcd scio art. — nihil ...deesset Cic. is here striving t0 rep-
resent the Greek airdpxas=selfsufficient for which there was no
one word in Latin. - ubi: here = qua in re rather than quo in loco.
Cf. Tusc. 5, 102 cur rgitur dabitiae desiderentur, aut ubi paupertas
beatus esse non sinit? ib. 121 me conscripturum libres arbritor-ubi
euim melius utipossumus hoc . . . otio ? — studia nostra: the strength
and ardor of my affection.
