22 NOTES TO LAELIUS. 67

oi the verb nequire. -— qui: see n. on C. M. 4, p. 3. —vita vitalis:
it is not known to what work ol Ennius the quotation belongs. The
words are an imitation ot Bias βιωτός. In his own style, Cic. would
have written vita potest esse nlla ,· cf. 86 vr'tam csse nullam = βίον
εἶναι ἀβίωτον. - quae . . . conquiescit: ‘which does not find peace
in an interchange of kindness with a friend ’. Cf. Aristot. Eth. Nic
9, 9, 3. —quid dulcius: the omission of both enim and est gives
an abrupt emphasis to the question; so in 55, 30, 40, 25, .—
quicum: ci. n. on 2 quonam. For the sense of this passage Seyf-
fert well compares Seneca de Tranquill. Animi c.7 quantun bonnm
est nbi sunt praeparata pectora in quac tnta secretum omne descendat,
quarunt conscientiam minus qnam tuane timeas, quornm sermo sollici·
tudinem lcnint, sententia consilium expediit, hilaritas tristitiam dissipet,
conspectus ipse delectet—qui: lit. ‘what sort ofl’ Quis would
have meant merely ‘whati’ Tantus is here only a rhetorical vari-
ation ior magnus, and as tannes implies quantus there is really an
ellipsis. For the context ci. Aristot. Eth. Nic. 9, 9, 2. -— fructus:
‘enjoyment'.—ac·: see A. 156, a; G. 6463 Η. 554, Ι. 2, n. —
sine eo: takes the place oi a conditional clause. See A. 3¹03 G.
594, 33 H. 507, 3, n. 7. —quae expetuntur: ‘which are objects
of desire '. Cic. commonly uses expetere, expetenda to represent the
Greek αἱρεῖν, αἱρετά, which are technical terms common to all the
later Greek philosophical schools. Anything which forms partos
the summurn bonurn is αἱρετόν. Cf. 46 expetendas; 80 expetita. -
valetudot=here the boruz n. oi 203 ct. n. on 8. —amicitiaz ad·
versative asyndeton. -- loco: perhaps abl. of separation with ex·
cluditur. Nulla loca may however have an adverbial sense equivalent
to that of nusquam. The adverb praesto in the preceding clause
makes this probable, and the probability is increased by pluribus locis
below. A. 258, χ, G. 385, Rem.; H. 425, 2. — ut aiunt: n. on 19.
Fire and water were fixed upon as the first necessaries of lile in the
aqua ct igni enterdictio, which was equivalent to a sentence oi exile.
Cf. Off. 1, 52 ex qua snnt illa concnrnnin (efficta), non prohibere aqua
profluente, pati ab igne rjrnem capere siqui velit; Iustiniani Inst. 1,
16, 23 Gaii Inst. 1, 161. — quae...prodest: a sidelong protest
against the theory (18) that only the nopai are capable oi friendship.
-delectat et prodest: so Hor. A. P. 333 aret prodesse voluntaut
delectare poetae—vera et perlecta: ‘pure and faultless’; the
nehela φιλία of Aristotle (Eth. Nic. 8, 6, 2) also ἡ ὣς ἀληθῶς φιλία
