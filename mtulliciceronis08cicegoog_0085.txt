meaning ‘probably'3 in later writers negative, with the sense ‘prob-
ably not’. See Roby, 2256; A. 210, ſs Rem.; G. 459, Rem.; H. 529,
3, n. 2. — excepta...datum: cf. Plato, Timaeus 4713 φιλοσοφίας
γένος, οὗ μεῖζον ἀγαθὸν οὔτ’ ἦλθεν οὔθ’ ἥξει ποτὲ τῷ θνητῷ γένει δωρηθὲν
ἐκ θεῶν, which Cic. thus turns in his translation, at the end of the
fragment of it which is preserved: quo bono nullum optabilius nullum
praestantius neque datum est mortalium generi deorum concessu atque¹
munere neque dabitur. Cic. frequently imitates the passage, as belov'vy
473 Academica r, 73 Tusc. 1, 64; Leg. 1, 58. —divitias alii ete:
cf. closely 86. —extremum : extremum here :fim's, in the sense of
finis bonorum or summum butam. The passage is aimed a Epicurus
and his followers who pecudis et hominis aliem bonum censen (Academ.
1, 6).

P. 9. - caduca et incerta: ‘fleeting and unstable ’ς cf. De Dom.
146 caduca semper et mobilia. — illi: sc. faciunt. Illi, the Stoics and
Peripatetics. — nec sine ete: cf. 18 nisi iu bonis amicitiam esse non
posse. This matter is touched on by Aristotle, Eth. Nic. 8, 1, 73 ih.
8, 2, 3seq. - esse: emphatic; ‘exist '.

21. iarn : = ‘to proceed ⁹, as often. - consuetudine sermonis:
cf. Verr. 4, 109 cotidiana dt'cendi consuetudine. —- nee .. . metiamur: =
not intended to contrast strongly with the first part of the sentence,
otherwise nora would have been written for nec audeam omitted.
The clause is really explanatory=rron metientes. For the construc-
tion 0f metiri cf. n. on 97, and for the expression μετρεῖν τι τινι in
Aristotle’s Ethics. — magnificentia: cf. Plato Symp. 2101) καλοὺς
λόγους καὶ μεγαλοπρεπεῖς. So magnificum in 32. —virosque2 ‘⁸ If
a negative proposition is followedby an affirmative, in which the
same thought is expressed or continued, que, et or ac is employed
in Latin where in English we use ‘but’ ”. Madvig, 433, Obs. ²3
cf. Roby, 2200. — Paulos etc: the plural in the sense of ‘men
like Ρ.’ etc. For Paulus, cf. 93 for Gallus 9and 105 for Philus 14.
— omnino . . . reperiuntur: cf. 9, 18, n. on mma.

22. opportunitates: the word opportunitas is ‘opportuneness’
rather than ‘opportunity’. To say that friendship has ‘opportune-
nesses’ is equivalent to saying that it shows the characteristic of
‘opportuneness' on many occasions. Cicero uses the plural of ab
straet nouns like this more frequently than any other author. Cf.
A.75, c; G. 195, Rern. 5; H. 130, 2.—vix queo: Cic. always
says nan queo or vix queo, never nequeo, though he uses other parts
