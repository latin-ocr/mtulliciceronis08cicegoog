INTRODUCTION. vii

His gentleness and affability were great¹ His cheeriulness and
humorousness were samous.²

During his life and after his death Laelius bore the title sapiens
or ‘the wise’,⁸ a title which implies more oi practical than of
intellectual wisdom‚ though it would not have been given to any
one who was destitute ol culture and literary excellence. Alto·
gether Laelius is Cicero's typical example oi the best results ol
cultivation acting on a character which exhibited in their lullest
extent the ideal Roman virtues. He is introduced as an inter-
locutor into two other dialogum, the Cato Maior with Scipi0‚ and
the De Re Publica along with Scipio, Fannius, and Scaevola.

The friendship of Laelius and Scipio was one of the most
famous in antiquity. Laelius, says cicero, reverenced Scipio as
agod; Scipio looked up to Laelius, his senior, as a parent⁴

The views oi friendship which Laelius gives in the dialogue ι

are said by him to be mainly those of Scipio.

(2.) Scaevam Scaevola belonged to a iamily of lawyers,⁶
and was himself exceedingly distinguished lor his knowledge of
the law. He was born about 157, and lived till 88 nc. In 121
he was praetor, and governor of Asia. On his return a mali·
cious prosecution was set on loot against him on a charge of
malversation (repetundarum), but on this he was acquitted.
Soon afterwards he was elected consul ior the year ¹17· He
seems to have had but little political ambition‚ though owing
to his high character and his freedom from partisanship he
exercised in the senate and in private a great political influence.
His house was daily thronged by the leading men oi Rome.⁷
