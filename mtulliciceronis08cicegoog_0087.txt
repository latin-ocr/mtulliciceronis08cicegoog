two participles differ very little in meaning-no more widely than
‘dividing’ and ‘sharing’ in English. In partiens the notion of mere

division is more prominent, in communicans the notion of comrade· ,

ship or partnership; ci. 24 iu periculis...corumuuicandis.

P. 10. -23, commoditates: very little different in sense from
opportunitates in 22. Opportunitas expresses rather the idea oi ex·
ceptional appropriateness, commoditas rather the characteristic oi
usefulness as an ordinary fact. -—- cum ...contineat— turn .. . prae·
stat: the normal construction with eum...tum is for both clauses
to have the same verb, or for the verbs (it differentljn both clauses
to be in the same mood and tense. The reason ior the variation
here is the desire to point out that the fact contained in the clause
cum...coutincat is one which has been already mentioned and dis-
posed of. ‘Seeing that friendship furnishes very many and impor-
tant advantages...'. Continet would have been appropriate had the
fact now been mentioned for the first time. Cf. Madvig, 358, Obs. 33 -

abl, sc. commoditate,· ct. 19 hoc praestat; omuibus=omnibus rebus,
the verbs praestat and praelucet having the same subiect, amicitia.
Many editors, in order to avoid the exceptional omnibus=omuibus
rebus, make illa (sc. eorumoditas) subject to praestat so that omreilsus
=o. commoditatibus, while praelucet has ior its subject amicitia. The
neuter omnibus used as substantive, though rare, is well attested;
cf. N. D. 2, 36; 2,133; De Fato ¹43 Liv. 1, 453 3, 23.—spem
praelucet: the verb praelucere is rare even in poetry and very rare
in prose. The transitive use (‘ holds up the light of hope ’) may
perhaps be allowed here, though the only passages quoted for it by
the editors and dictionaries are Auson. Idyll. 4, 95 p. lumen, and
Plaut. Casina 1, 30 psorem Plin. Nat. Hist.32, 141 has praeluceat

is to be taken in a less strict sense than in 22 aera coercitio. —-
