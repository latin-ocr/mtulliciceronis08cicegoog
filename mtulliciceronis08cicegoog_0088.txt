-- egentes abundant etc: St. Paul, Corinth. 2,6‚ 10 ‘As having
nothing, and yet possessing all things ’ς ib. 6, 9 ‘As dying and behold,
we live ⁹. — difficilius dictu: ‘a harder saying '. The Latin like
the English phrase is inaccurate, since the statement is not hard to
make, but hard to believe. Cf. Mark 2, 9 ‘Whether is it easr'er to
ray to the sick of the palsy...’ Cic. often has incredibile dictu ; ci.
Liv. 3, 5,12 difficile adfidem esi affirmare. —tantus eos honos:
for the separation ot nrnnts from hortos cf. n. on C. M. 15 quam sit
iusta. —- ex quo: the antecedent ot quo is not desiderem, but the
whole preceding clause; thus ex quo=ex qua re. — beata...
laudabilis: chiasmus. — laudabilis: because the survivors do
well in remembering their friends. —rerum natura: i. e. the
universe— benevolentiae coniunctionem: ‘the houd ot good-
will'3 benevolentia, the more diffused and weaker form of affection,
is here contrasted with amicitia, its more concentrated and intense
form. Benevolentrir here is Aristotle’s ὁμόνοια in Eth. Nic. 9, c. 6.
-ne...quidem: ‘n0, nor‘; simply a stronger nee—id: ex-
plained by the clause quanta...sit.—minus: here, and often,
scarcely different in sense from non. — vis amicitiae: cf. 15. —
percipi: a stronger word than intellegitur just before. —quae
enirn domus etc: cf. Sallust, Iug. 10, 6 concordio parvae res crescunt,
discordia maximae dilabuntur,· Matthew, 12, 254- discidiis: so
rightly written, not elissidir's. Most scholars now agree with Madvig
(ad Cic. Fin. Exc. II. p. 812 etseq.) in denying dissideam to be a
Latin word.

24. quidem: often used like the Greek γε or γοῦν to introducea
statement confirming a previous statement. —doctum quendam:
Empedocles born about 485 Β. e. Cicero is very careful not to make
Laelius betray too intimate an acquaintance with Greek literature.
cf. n. on 87 nescio quem. — vaticinatum: ‘sang¹ in inspired strain '.
The vater is dinnao quodam spiritu rizs‘lntus (Arch. 18); cf. also voti·
cini furores in Ov. Met. 2, 640. The great philosophical poem of
Empedocles, περὶ φύσεως, the title oi which is borrowed by Lucretius
tor his poem ‘De Rerum Natura ⁹, and which he greatly ineuntes,
contained many passages that seemed to sober-minded readers to
border on madness; cf. dead. 2, 14 isti exclament quasi niente incitati,
