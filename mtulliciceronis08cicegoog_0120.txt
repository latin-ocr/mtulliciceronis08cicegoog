cusses the question how great a difference in character or other cir'·
cumstances is required to render friendships impossible. Cf. Eth.
Nic. 8, 7, 4.

et saepe instead oi ner; tor the slight anacoluthon ct.79,104.—-

optolemus: or Pyrrhus son ot Achilles by Deidamia, daughter ot
Lycomedes, king oi Scyros. He appears in the Philoctetes as an
ambassador to that hero, without whose bow it was fated Troy should
not fall. Welclrer thinks that Cicero here refers to a scene in a lost
play ot Sophocles entitled attalanae - impedientem: seen. on
C. M. Η rt'e'videnti.

P. 29. -mollisquet the que merely connects infirmus with mallet
and does not correspond with the first et. In Cicero and the best
writers et and que do not correspond. Trans. ‘is not only weak and
effeminate, but also...'. —parum iustus: ‘far trom reasonable'3

— in omni re: ‘on every occasion '. — iam enim ete: the verae
amicitae or perfectae are sempiternae: see 3² and Aristot. Eth. Nic. 8,

cussed in 32 seq. and is considered by Aristotle in Eth. Nic. 9, 3. —'-
sapientiumx=virarum bonarum as defined in 21. — volgaria
amicitias: these differ only in degree from the aerae amicitiae, being
based on a less degree ot virtus, since virtus a caritate volgi non abhor-
ret (50), hence they must not be confounded with the atalae based on
rh ἡδύ aud eh ὠφέλιμον which Aristotle so often discusses. These
latter friendships Cicero refuses to deal with; see 58 etc. —oratio
delabitur: so 100 aratia defluxit ,· cf. Qu. Fr. 1, ι’, 18 adpraecrjtiendi
