52 NOTES TO LAELIUS. [8-

ά. Lael. 64 constantem, stabilem. Constantia (often coupled with
gravitas, fides and the like) formed an important part oi the char·
acter oi the ideal Roman. Cic. complains (Flacc. 36) nullam can-
stantiam in Graecis haminibus essa. —- contingere: here distinctly
used oi bad fortune, though the old traditional distinction between
contingere on the one hand and accidere, evenire on the other required
the word to be used of good iortune only. See n. on C. M. 8.

9. tribui: i. e. by people in general. - agnosco: sc. mila tri·

bui. Nagelsbach stilistik5114 supplies tanquam debitum milri.— '

iacis amice: a polite expression oi thanks, like benefacis in Acad.
1, 2 5. — ut videris: ior the personal construction taking the place
oi the impersonal at videtur, cf. Att. 5, 18, 2 consilia, ut videmur,
bonis utiaeur. The usage is somewhat uncommon. — nemo: the
Stoics attached such superhuman excellencies to their σοφός or sa·
piens, that doubts were often expressed whether such a person ever
existed in the flesh. Cf. 18 and Tusc. 2, 5¹ in qua aera erit perfecta
sapientia, quem adhuc nos quidem vidimus neminem. —si quisquam ἱ
like the parenthesis commonly used in Greek, εἰ καὶ τις ἄλλος. So
in Latin sometimes si quisquam alius, as in Brut. 126. -- iili: cf.
C. M. 12 and 84 He was praetor designatus when he died and had
served with distinction against Perseus, under L. Aemilius Paulus,
whose daughter he had married (C. M. 15). On the form of the gen.
see Α. 40, b; G. 29, Rem.1; Η. 51, 5. -memineram Paulum,
videram Gallumt sc. mortem filiorum serre. Where memini is thus
used with the accus. oi a person there is an ellipsis oi an infinitive;
cf. De Or. 3, 133 meminerant illi Sextum Aelium ; M '. aera Mani·
lium nos raam vidimus. Paulus (Macedonicus) lost two sons, one
immediately before, the other immediately aiter, his great triumph
in 168 B. c. Cf. Fam. 4, 6,1 L. Paulus duas septem diebus (sc. filias
amisit), C. M. 68 with n. C. Sulpicius Gallus served as tribunus
militum under Paulus, and was consul 157 uc. He was famous as
an astronomer, and was the first Roman who predicted an eclipse
(Liv. 44, 37). —sed hi: sc. mortemfiliarum, or rather talem casam
tulerant. —in pueris: literally ‘in the case of boys '. Trans.
‘but their sons were boys, while Cato’s was, etc’. — perstem?
this seems here merely to mean ‘adult’ in opposition to pueris.

10. cave...ne...quidem: Cic. here treats cave as a negative
verb. He frequently follows up negative words with negative, where
in English we should use affirmative, expressions; thus ne. ..quidem
