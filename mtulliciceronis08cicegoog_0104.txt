ing the death ol both these men, as Cic. himself states in Brut. 42 and
43, where he refers to Thuc. 1, 138. In Att.9, 10, 3 he assumes that
Coriolanus died a natural death. -— nemo: the inference intended
is ‘so much worse are the Romans now than their toretathers‚ and
than the Greeks ot Themistocles’ time ’.

43. talis: i. e. such as that described in 41.

P. 18.-supplicio: a stronger word than poena above, 423 in its
strict sense supplicium means ‘summary execution ’ζ For supplicio
amni=surnma cf. pro Imp. Cn. Pomp. 11. -- concessum: saissa.
—- haud scio an: see n. on 20. —- curae: n. on 15 cardi.

44. haec . ..iaciamus: these words almost exactly repeat the first
sentence of 40. Notice that the clauses are put side by side without
connecting partiales—rogemur: A. 3²8³ G. 5743 H. 519, ll. 2.
— libere: = μετὰ παρρησίας, ‘with all freedom of speech ’. —
aperte: ‘frankly ’. ct. 91 monere et maneri etc. - adhibitae: sc.
auctoritati.

45. nam: ‘I say this, lor’ ; slightly elliptic3 see n. on 41· “--
quos audio ete: ct. n. on 24 doctum quendam, and lor audio n. on 41
audierat. Observe that Cic. writes habitas, not haberi. — placu-
isse: ‘some ...have held as dogmas'; the word placere has often a
much stronger sense than our ‘please'. — mirabilia: παράδοξα, a
word which Cic. translated sometimes by mirabilia (Acad. 2, 136),
sometimes by admirabilia ¹(Parad. prooem. 43 Fin. 4, 74), sometimes
by admiranda. -— sed: in contrast to nn'rabilia- ‘paradoxes in-
deed, but'. -partimt there is slight anacoluthon here; the sen·
tence is closed without the second partim which should correspond to
this, and its place is taken by alios at the beginning oi the next sen·
’ tence. Both partim and alii refer to quibusdam. Such anacolutha,
where only one of a pair of words such as alter-alter, alius-alius etc.
is expressed and the other replaced, in another sentence, by some
other expression, are very common in Cic. Madvig has collected a
large number of examples in the first excursus toliis De Finibus. —
fugiendas ete: Cic. is here evidently imitating a chorus of the Hip-
polytus of Euripides 253 etseq. The sentiment is the same as that
in Sophocles' Ajax 680 etseq. — nimias: ‘too strong ’, ‘too close '.
—sibiz ior the almost pleonastic use cf. Tusc. 5, 4² amnia sibi iri
se posita censebit, and the use in comedy oi saus sibi. —laxissimas
habenas: aparaphrase of l. 2 56 ot the passage ref. to above, αὔλακα
δ’ εἶναι στέργηθρα φρενῶν. The collocation habenas babere seems in·
