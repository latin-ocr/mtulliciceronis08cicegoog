G. 379; H. 404, and n. 1. -fecisset putaret: firceret could not
have been written because Gracchus was dead, but the mind having
once been carried back to the past, it is permissible to use the imper·
fects vellet andpntaret to denote that so long as Gracchus con tin-
ued to live, the opinion of Btossius continued as here described
On the mood of ficisset see Roby‚1744; A. 321, o; G. 541; H. 516,
