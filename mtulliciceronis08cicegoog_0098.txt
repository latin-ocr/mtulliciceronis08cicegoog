in 490 Β. c. because in time of famine he proposed to give the plebei-
ans no share of the grain, sent by Gelon of Syracuse, until they had
given up their tribunes. In league with the Volscians he then marched
against Rome, and was dissuaded from taking the city only by the
tears and supplicatione of his mother and other matrons. See Liv.

The Blosii or Blossii were a noble family at Cumae (Cic. Leg. Agr.
2, 93, Liv. 23, 7, 83 27, 3, 5). This member of the family was a
Stoic philosopher and pupil of Antipater of Tarsus. On the incident
see Liddell‚ History of Rome, Ch. 52, §a — aderam...in con·
silio: ‘was present as one of the advisers to ...’ The consiliam was
a most important institution in both the public and the private life
of the Romans. There was deeply ingrained in the Roman mind a
feeling that no person having serious business to transact, whether
private or official, ought to proceed without taking the opinion of
those best qualified to advise him. The body of advisers is the con-
silium. The senate was the consilium of the king, and then became
the standing consilium of the consuls. Officials exercising judicial
functions generally summoned to their aid leading lawyers; in the

’ case here mentioned, as the trials were political, statesmen of expe·

rience were resorted to. On this special commission (below, page 16
