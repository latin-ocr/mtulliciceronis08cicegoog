46 NOTES TO LAELIUS. [4.

5 hoec Academico, ui scis, cum Catulo Lucullo Hortensio contuleram.
Sane in personas non cadebant; ib.13,16,1 ecce tatae litterae de Var-
rone. Nemini viso est optior Ἀντιοχεία ratio. - loqueretur: Cic.
very frequently uses loqui (but not aficere) when the subject is an
abstract noun, as here persona practically is. ’ So Fin. 2, 48 consuetudo
loquitur ,· ib. 4, 41 institutio hominis si loqueretur ,· Acad. a, 101 con·
clusio loquitur. For the mood see n. on dissereret below. -- floru-
isset: at first sight this seems a reference to the physica] and mental
powers for which Cato was famous fn advanced age. Cic, however,
does not use florere in the sense of vigere ; Nauck therefore is prob
ably right in supposing the word to refer to the general worldly
prosperity of Cat0, indicated in C. M. 8. On the subjunctive see A.
320,e; G. 6363 H. 517· —maxime memorabilem: superlatives
from adjectives in -bilis are rare. In 51 we have amabilissimum:
Cato has stabilissimus, Columella mirabilissimam, and mobilissimus is
commum these are all the instances which appear until post-Augus-
tan times. Several adjectives of this class, as laudabilis, probabilis,
flebilis, have comparativeS, but no superlatives, in pre-Classical or
Classical Latin. -- disputata: it is not necessary to supply esse so

as to make this a case of the perfect infinitive after mmzinisset. Dis· '

putore aliquid (cf. n. on 1) often means not ‘to discuss an opinion ',
but ‘to put an opinion forward in discussion ’, and so to defend or
maintain it.--dissereret: A. 320, s: G. 633ς H. 503, II. 2. --
meminisset: A. 3423 G. 631: H. 529, II. —genus hoc ser·
monum:= sermones iuius generis: cf. 12 quo degenere mortis ,¹
93 quod genus amici. ⁸—- positum: A. 290, a: G. 669; H. 549, 1.
-hominum veterum: ‘men of the olden time '. — et eorum:
introduced for sake of emphasis. G. 293, Rem. 23 H. 451, 2. ——
nescio quo pacto: ‘somehow ’. See A. 334, e; G. 469, Rem. 23
H. 529, 5, 3). —mea: sc. scripta, as in Acad. 1, 8 nihil magno
opere nieorum mr'ror.

⁵. senem senex: at the time the Cato Maior was written Atticus
was 65 and Cic. 62. Note the fondness of Cic. as well as of other
Latius for bringing into juxtaposition different cases of the same
word. So De Or. 2, 3¹⁰ rebus res and Lucr. 1, 359 res rebus; cf.
also below, 25 iustitium iustissimo. See Α. 344,g; G. 683; H. 563.
—hoc libro: this corresponds to tum above, rrum would have

been more fonnally correct 3 so below tum...nunc. Li'ber is put in ,

the abl. without in when the whole book is referred to, with in when
