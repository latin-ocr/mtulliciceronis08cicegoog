strengthens the negation. A. 209, a, 13 G. 4443 H. 553, 2. For the

292, Rem. 13 H. 450, a, n. Inshcm...d1eta we have the contrast
between the life of action, the πρακτικὸς βίος, which the Romans re-
garded as the only proper life for aman of rank, and the literary or
contemplative life, the θεωρητικὸς βίος. The Romans looked on all
departments of thought and literature as graceful adjuncts to alife
of activity, but nothing more. Cf. n. on 16 nemus otiosi—ne-
gem: See G. 598, Rem. 23 H. 509, n. 2. —quam id recte: see
n. on C. M. 15. -- viderint sapientes: ‘how far I am right is for
the wisc mento consider '. The literal rendering of viderint would
be ‘shall by and by consider ', viderint being probably not perfect
subjunctive, but future perfect indicative. Phrases like this are
thoroughly discussed by Roby, Gr, Vol. Il. Preface, p. cvi, and ᾖ 1593.

Ἴ By sapientes no doubt the Stoics are meant, who taught that men

ought to be entirely unaffected by any emotions. either of pain or
of pleasure. — moveor enim: supply desiderio from the preceding
sentence. — confirmare: the sense is rather stronger than that of
affirmare. —me ipse: cf. n. on 5 te ipse — decessu: abl. of
cause and time. — nihil mali etc: the same opinion is expounded
at length in Tusc. Disp, Book 1 ; cf. especially 5111. See also the
reflectionson the death of Hortensius in Brut. 5 5, and Fam. 5, 16, 4
nihil mali etseq. — incommodior the word is here pointedly con·
trasted with mali. There is no doubt a slight reference tothe Stoic
theory of προηγμένα and ἀποπροηγμένα. Although only virtue is
bonum, only vice molum in the eyes of the Stoics‚ still there are
such differences among other things as will incline the wise men to
desire some of them tepoqyptee=sumendat and reject others (ἀπο-
nominantem or incommoda), his real happiness, however,
remaining absolutely unaffected. Cf. Acad. 1, 36 and 373 see Zeller,
, Stoice, Epicureans, and Sceptics, Ch. 103 Ueberweg, History of Phi·
losophy, §55; Ritter, Hist. ot Ancient Philosophy, Book ΙΙ. Ch.5
-- amicum ...se : to be construed with amentis.

11. cum illo...praeclare: ‘who would say that his destiny has
not been glorious'3 lit. ‘that he has not been dealt with (eie. by the
gods or fates) splendidlyt’ Cf. 153 also Academ. 2, 128 quaeret
