hardly ever so strong in meaning as our word ‘despise ⁹, which is com·
monly used to translate it. See n. on C. M. 43 spreto et contempta.
- contingit: n. on 8. — qui: ‘and they ’.

⁷3. ille: sc. possit. — non...neque: cf. n. on to. There is a

slight anacoluthon, the form oi the sentence being changed; for the .

proper clause introduced by a second neque the clauses introduced by
utare substituted. ct. n. on 45 partim. The unemphatic tu should
be noticed; it is our English 'you’ for ‘one ’. - excellas: ci. excel·
lentior in 69. -perducerez i. c. through all the various grades.
Producere (which some editions have) is simply ‘to advance ', without
the notion of gradation. — potuit . .. non potuit: cf. n. on to In
Tusc 4, 40 Rupilius is said to have taken his brother’s defeat greatly
to heart; and Pliny, Nat. Hist. 7, ᾗ 122 enlarges the story by making
him die immediately on hearing the result ol the electiori. - effi-

had preceded; old edd. indeed insert oportet, which is unnecessary.
In Finz, 103 quod si dier notandus filit, mosne potius quo natos an
eum quo sapienssoctus est the words oportet notare have to be supplied
from notandus. In his n. there Madvig excellently illustratos the
usage both irom Latin and irom Greek. — isto modo: ‘on that

ally slaves. - vetustatis: n. on 68. - quidem: here concessive,
‘I admit ’, as in 13.— alio quodam modo: n. on 6. - mores
etc: mores is probably in the accusative, not, as Lahm. suggests,
