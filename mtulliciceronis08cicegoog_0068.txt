cognomen is applied to the inherited third name Cato and to the ac·
quired name sapiens. In late Latin agnomen was applied to the
latter to mark the distinction.

7. te...esse sapientem: this clause was intended to depend on
ext'stimant below, but owing to the great length of the sentence Cic.
made a pause at iudicatum, and repeated the gist of the sentence
down to that point in the words kanc...sapientiam, which depend
on existimant. The sentence is an example oi anacoluthon.—
non solum ...doctrina: here natura denotes the intellectual endow·
ments with which a man is born, and mores his natural character ;
cf. ²7· Studium or devotion to the pursuit of learning depende
on atores, doctrina or attainment on this combined with natura. The
two words natura and mores together comprise the natural endow·
ments of a man, while studium and doctrina indicate his acquire·
ments. Cf. Acad. 1, 203 Arch. 15. Studio et doctrina ‘by devotion
and culture’; not a case ofhendiadys. Cf. n. on C. M. 15 iuven·
tute et viribus: De Or. 1, 22 ; Arch. 3. -- reliqua: this word is

· proleptic or anticipative, since its sense is not fully seen till we come

to Athenis which completes the contrast. So ceteras is often used,
and λοιπός, ἄλλος in Greek. — septem: ‘the seven ', sapientes
being understood, as in 59. So x11 alone often stands for ΧΠ tabac-
lae (Leg. 2, 59, 60), and Asinius Pollio has (in Cic. Fam. 10, 32, 2)
xlv ior xlv ordines. — subtilius: ‘with more than usual accu-
racy’. Subtilvk is often the exact equivalent of the Greek ἀκριβής.
·-— non habent: Cic. in Off. 3,16 denies the title sapiens not only
to the seven, but to Cato and to Laelius himself. —unumt em·
phatic: ‘one only '‚ ν’. e. Socrates Cic. nearly always leaves the
English ‘only’ unexpressed, but occasionally he uses modo, and once
(head. 2, 74) tantum. —et eum quidem: these words add em-
phasis to sapientissimum ,¹ cf. 4 eteorum and n. -- Apollinis...
iudicatum: Socrates in Plato’s Apology‚ p. 21 A merely says that
the oracle declared that no one was wiser than himself (μηδένα σοφόν
τερον εἶναι). The person who put the inquiry to the oracla Chae-
rephon,a pupil of Socrates, was dead when the trial took place, but
his brother bore evidence to the facts. Xenophon in his Apology,
§14 (ii it be his) makes Socrates speak more definitely about the
oracles - ἀνεῖλεν ὁ Ἀπόλλων μηδένα εἶναι ἀνθρώπων ἐμοῦ μήτε ἐλειν
θεριῶτερον μήτε δικαιότερον μήτε σωφρονέστερον. In another part of
the Apology by Plato (330) Socrates says that the lile he followed
