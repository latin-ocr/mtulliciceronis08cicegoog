σο] noras ro uacuus. 95

quotes a saying oi Solon: φίλους μὴ ταχὺ κτῶ· οὓς δ’ ἂν κτήσῃ, μὴ
ἀποδοκίμαζε. Aristot. Eth. Nic. 9,3 discusses the causes which may
justify the dissolution oi friendships. — tempus: καιρόν, an occa·
sion. ,

Ρ. 24.-61. sure ulla exceptione: attributive. — aut caput
agatur aut fama: for the arrangement oi the words cf. n. on 8 cum
etc. Caput is status, or condition regarding civil rights, which in the
Roman Law was viewed with reference to liberty (status libertatis),
citizenship (status ciuitatis), and domestic position (stritus familiae).
See Hadley's, or Hunter’s, Introd. to Roman Law. The cases alluded
to are those which might lead to deminutio capitis, the loss oi civil
rights. Infirma the reference is to trials involving infamiis as part of
the punishment which may result from them. — declinandum de ’
via sit: on the nice question of casuistry, how far one is to condone
the wrong doings oi a friend, Laelius is conveniently vague, as Gellius
in his criticism of this passage (Noct. Att. 1, 3, 14) complains. The
passage becomes the more unsatisfactory when we go back to Laelius’
first principle in 18 ni'si' in bonis amicitiam esse non posse. Aristotle’s
discussion of the matter tEth. Nic. 9, 4, 3) is more careful though still
vague. Roman popular morality required a man to go much greater
lengths in assisting a friend than would be allowed even by the popular
morality ot our time; this is expressed in the words modone sum m a
turpitudo sequamur. -possit: subjunctive of characteristic. Quu-
tenuris here a relative adverb. Roby, 1680, 1686. - nec...fama:
i. e. propter amicum. - res: here=publicas res. — telum: for
the metaphorica] use cf. the old line quoted by Cic. in Fam. 7, 16, 1:
usquequaque sapere oportet: id erit telum acerrimum. — blanditiis et
assentando: it is not often that Cic. makes the gemnd thus range
with a noun, though the usage is exceedingly common in Tacitus and
his contemporaries. Cf. Fin. 3, 34.

62. cuius .. . de amicitia: ‘from whom entirely proceeded the dis-
course conceming iriendship’3 not ‘whose whole discourse was of
friendship'. — diligentiores: ‘more painstaking’, i. e. ‘than in
friendship ⁹. — capras et ovis: imitated from Xenoph. Mem. 2, 4,
4: 2, 4. 1. — non posse dicere: n. on 193 cf. also 73 potuit... non
potuit. - in amicis: asyndeton3 cf. n. on 13 tum. - quasi
signa quaedam et notas: a tentative translation oi the Greek σημεῖον
or κριτήριον, which Cic. elsewhere reuders by iudicium (Academ. pas·
sim) or nota merely (Acad. 2, 84); cf. also N. D. 1, 12 certa rudi'candi
