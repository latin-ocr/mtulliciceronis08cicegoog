John S. white, LL.D., Heod-Moeter Berkelay School, New York city. -
Comstock's Latin Book Ι find the best book lor its purpose that I have ever
used. The review oi English Grammar at the beginning; the separation
ol the vocabularies from the exercises ; judicious and progressive presen-
tation of the various uses of the verb in the different moods; and 11111111-
densed exhibit of the grammon-are such valuable features gathered
within the covers oi 1 text-book, that it has no rival.

Prot. Η. C. Missimer, Hiyh 811111, Eric, Pa-It isvery easy to see
that Comstock's First Latin Book is the work of a thorough toacher,
who has had actual experience in the class-room with the difficulties which
beginners in Latin usually meet its classitlcation and methods are thor-
ough and complete ; its language is clear and simple. Mr. Comstock has
hit the nail on the head. He knows just what and just how much grammar
is needed for good, clean work. We have had Leighton and Jones, -both
good, -but we like Comstock more, because it is better.
