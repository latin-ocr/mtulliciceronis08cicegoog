4² NOTES TO LAELIUS. [1

like μνημονικῶς (Xen. Cyr. 5, 3, 46). Madvig is right in saying (on
Fin. 1, 34) semper hoc uocabulum laudem habet bonae et copiosae memo·
riae. — nec dubitare := et (solebat) non dubitare. See note on Cato
Maior, 16 non dubitauit dicere. - sapientem: see Introd. p. vii.
—ita eram deductus ete: ‘had been introduced to Scaevola
with this design, that ete' For this sense oi deducere, to introduce a
young man to a master or guardian, cf. Cael. 9 ut huic virilem togam
dedit.. .leunc a patre continuo ad me esse deductum. It was a common
practice to attach youths tor a time to the society oi distinguished ju·
rists or orators; see Tac. Dial. 34; Quint. 12, 11, 6. - Scaevolam τ
but above (line 1) Q. Mucius, in both cases the same person, Lah-
meyer quotes similar changes irom· Cic. Dom.115; Sall. lug. 27, 43
Nep. Hamilc. 1‚3 and 5. — virili toga: called also toga pura (as
in Att. 7, 8, 5) to distinguish it from the toga praetexto, sometimes
called merely praetexta, the purple-bordered robe worn at Rome by
magistrates and children. The toga oi the ordinary adult citizen was
not dyed. The loga uirilis was generally assumed at the beginning oi
the seventeenth year. See Becker’s Gallus, Excursus 1, Scene 8. —
quoad possem et liceret: cf. Lucr. 2, 850 quoad lt'cer oc possis ,· Cic.

...discederemz an exaggerated expression, as in Balb. 5 accusator
firtetur hunc numquam a Memmio discessisse ,· Liv. 37, 53, 18 numquam
'a conmle abscessi. -ab eo...disputata: Cic. sometimes allows
deputare in the active to govern an accusative oi a neuter pronoun,
in place oi the usual constr, de with abl. In his use oi the passive
he is more free3 thus he says in De Or. 1, 22 νε quaesita et disputata,
though he would hardly say rem disputare ior de νε disputare. cf. 4.
— prudentia: this word usually implies not wisdom in general but
skill in some special subject; here Roman Law; ci. prudens in iure
in 6.—pontilicem Scaevolam: Q. Mucius Scaevola, Pontifex
Maximus, was a relative oi Scaevola the Augur. He was a man of
exalted character and great abilities both as a jurist and as an orator.
He is said to have been the first Roman who wrote a systematic trea-
tise on the Civil Law, and his work on that subject, iu eighteen books,
had great influence on succeeding jurists. lie was consul in 95 Β. c,
and having been proscribed by the party of Marius lost his lile in a
riot, Β. c. 82. - me . . . contuli: contrast this with a patre deductus
eram above. — unum . . . praestantissimum: this emphatic use oi
unus with the superlative is common in Cic, ε. g. Tusc. a, 643 4, 553
