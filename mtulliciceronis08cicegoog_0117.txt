caniunctos,· so below, 74. -ipso equo: ‘even in the case of the
horse '. — quin: A. 319, d: G. 556, Remo, 55ο, Rem. 33 H. 5ο4, 1.
-quo consuevit: sc. uti.— montuosis etiam: the ancients
generally felt little or no admiration for wild and mountainous scenery.
Cicero had more feeling ior wild picturesqueness than most Romans.

69. maximum: :caput est in 45; cf. ²9 quod maius est. — su·
periorem etc.: superiorem is explained by 70 praestantem virtutis,
ingeni, fortunae. Cf. 32 sintque pares in amare et aequalrs; also 56.
Like Cicero, Aristotle accepts equality as essential to the highest kind
of friendship, as in Eth. Nic 8, 5, 5 λέγεται φιλότης ἡ labrom 8, 7, 3
labeas, b δὴ τῆς φιλίας εἶναι δοκεῖ. He discusses elaborately the ques· '
tion how this equality is to be understood and secured in friendships
of different kinds, but he admits that there are friendships, such as
that of parents for children, in which it cannot be securedl8,13,1
τῶν μὲν ἐν labrare φίλων barbereio δὲ καθ’ ὑπεροχήν).

P. 270-excellentiae quaedam: ‘certain superiorities’=beepo-
χαί rerem cf. 73 quarnais excellas,· Aristot. Eth. Nic. 8,13,1.—
grege: the word grex was often applied to philosophical schools, as
in De Or. 1, 42 philosophorum greges, with which cf. Acad. 1, 34

tamquam, quidam etc. to quality expressions either too strong or unu·
sual cf. 49 with n. — Philo... Rupilio...Mummio: see Introd.
p. v. — Maximum: i. e. Q. Fabius Maximus Aemilianus, the el·
dest son of Paulus Macedonicus, and adopted into the family oi the
Fabii. Africanus gave up to him his share in the inheritance of their
common father. See Paradoxa 48 liberalitatem Africani qui (Pauli)
baereditatis Q. Maximo fratri partem ruam concessit. — omnino: here
=‘n0 doubt ’, ·indeed’, ‘it is true‘3 so in 98, where however the
contrast is introduced by autem, as in C. M. 45 by sed, and in C. M.
28, Tusc. 2, 35 by sed tamen. — is: the insertion of a pronoun was
necessary, otherwise the subject to anteibat might have been supposed
to be Africanus, supplied from sibi. — suosque omnis etc: see 11
liberalitate in sorores.

70. si: note si followed by si, the suppositions being parallel, and
not contrasted with each other. Had they been contrasted stiae-sive
or si -sin would have been needed. In one sentence in Livy (4, 5, 5)
si is thus eight times repeated. — imbecilliore animo vel fortuna:
these are the persons mentioned in 59 in quibusdam... fractior. —
