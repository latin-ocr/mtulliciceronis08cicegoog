97] NOTES TO LAELIUS. 109

43, in which last passage it is called aureola) maintained that the state
had no right to control the order of religious observance. A curious
method was adopted to get over this objection. The electiori to priest-
hoods was at an assembly of a minority (17) of the 3 5 tribes, the par·
ticular tribes which took part in it being determined by lot. While,
theoretically, a resolution of the minority of the nation had no binding

' effect, and therefore could not be offensive to the gods, still in practice

the colleges were bound to appoint the persons so nominated‚ though
the form of coaptatio was gone through. The colleges of priests had
great influence in politics, hence the aristocrats desired to keep the
offices in their own hands. — ad populi beneficium: magistracies
are often called beneficia papuli Romani. —primus instituit eto:
. the interpretation of this passage is difficult. Plutarch, Life of C.
Gracchus, c. 5, tells the tale of C. Gracchus, and assigns to the act a
democratic purpose. Our passage certainly seems to countenance
Plutarch in this, but Lange, Romische Alterthume1112, 443, denies
that the act had any political aim. He connects it with achange in
the voting at public assemblies. This originally took place in the
comitium, which formed a small part of what was ordinarily called
the sarum. Lange thinks that when the voting was transferred from
the comitium to the sarpta (enclosures) the speakers naturally turned
their backs on the comitium and faced the saepta, the rastra being
placed between them. The matter is far from clear, and Lange's
explanation seems scarcely to be consistent with this passage. -
agerecum populo: the technical phrase for the laying oi matters
before the people in their assemblies. — vendibilem: ‘plausible’;
lit. ‘salabiet So Brut. 174 vendibilis aratar; Fin. 1, 12 nam ut sint
illa ventiibiliara, hacc uberiora certe sunt. — praetore me: as the
regular age ior the praetorship was 40, Laelius was probably born
about 186 Β. c. — re...auctoritate: since Laelius was not consul,
he carried his case on its merite and not from the auctoritas conferred
by office, which was then not summa.

P. 86. — 97. adumbratis: adumbrare is ‘to give in outline, or
incompletely’; the reference here is to misleading the people, not by
actual lies, but by partial presentation of the truth, quad valctsi moda
illustratum est. — illustratum: contrasts exactly with adum·
dratis above. - tota: tatd not tata. -- perpenditur: ‘is judged ⁸.
Perpendere is here the equivalent of metiri in 213 the ablativo con·
struction similarly follows on metiri there and on »radicare in 74. —
